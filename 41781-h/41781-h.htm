<p class="cap p0">HITHERTO the Contributions have appeared in a small
volume: but a friend having furnished me with the Manuscripts
of the following Letters, in order to do justice to the beautiful
designs, it has been necessary to increase the size of the work.
I trust that the merit of the drawings will reconcile my subscribers
to the increased price.</p>

<p>The observation on the style fittest for domestic architecture, the
description of the proposed house and the designs, are by Monsieur
De Chateauneuf; to these, Mr. Eastlake kindly added a very
valuable Letter on the Principles of Interior Decoration.</p>

<p>Monsieur De Chateauneuf is already known in this country by
his elegant work, <span class="smcap">Architectura Domestica</span>, and his design for
the new Royal Exchange; all who have visited Hamburg must be
well acquainted with the refined taste which characterizes the buildings
erected under his superintendance.</p>

<p>It is but justice to M. De Chateauneuf to state that his letters
were written merely as matter of amusement, and arose out of a
discussion with a friend, as to which was the best style to be
adopted for domestic architecture; the letters have been translated<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_4" id="Page_4">4</a></span>
from the German, and unfortunately have not had the advantage
of being submitted to the writer for correction.</p>

<p>It is proposed that the next volume should contain a reprint of
the late Mr. Whately's admirable work on Modern Gardening;
this it is hoped will be considered as a fit companion to the "<span class="smcap">Country
House</span>." I take this opportunity of thanking Mr. C. Knight
and Mr. Jackson, who kindly furnished me with the blocks from
which the vignettes have been printed.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">It</span> is now ten years since the first of these Schools was established, and instruction
is now afforded to nearly <em>one hundred and fifty</em> children of the poorer class, who, but
for this aid, would linger on in idleness and ignorance.</p>

<p>The teaching is not merely confined to reading and writing; the main object of
the Schools is to inculcate habits of industry, and to teach the principles and practice
of the Christian Religion.</p>

<p>On the formation of the Schools, the plan of self-support was adopted, each child
contributing a weekly payment&mdash;Infants, 1<i>d.</i>; Girls who are taught to work, and the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_6" id="Page_6">6</a></span>
younger Boys, pay 2<i>d.</i>; and the elder Boys, who are taught to write, 3<i>d.</i> Although
these payments go some way towards the maintenance of the Establishment, yet the
funds hitherto have been found very inadequate, and the deficiency has been supplied
by voluntary contributions, the produce of bazaars, ladies' work, &amp;c. One of the most
successful sources of profit has been a small Volume, printed under the title of
"Friendly Contributions;" the profits from the sale of this Work have been applied
to the support of the Schools: three Volumes have already appeared, and the present
forms the fourth.</p>

<p>It is conceived that it is unnecessary now to urge one word in favour of the absolute
necessity of affording education to all; the question is narrowed to the consideration
of what are the most efficient means by which this great object is to be accomplished;
it is hoped that, notwithstanding the many excellent charities which claim
the attention of the benevolent, few will be found unwilling to aid an Institution which,
in addition to teaching to read and write, instils habits of industry and inculcates the
principles of Christianity amongst the children of one of the poorest and most
populous districts around London.</p>

<p class="smcap">
Dear Sir,
</p>

<div style="width: 169px;">
<img class="drop" src="images/i_009b.jpg" width="169" height="170" alt="Illustrated drop cap letter A" />
</div>

<p class="illudrop p0">AS I am about to build a new house, I have
determined to avail myself of your assistance,
should it be convenient to you to give it. I
do not by so doing intend that it should be
supposed I think that the many very intelligent
architects in this country are incapable
of giving me good advice; but independently
of my friendship for you, and great respect
for your talents, I wish to consult one who is
not likely to be so much wedded to the routine
of modern Italian villas, Elizabethan houses, and thatched cottages, as is the
case with most of our English professors: not that I mean to say anything in
disparagement of a Palladian villa, always beautiful, though not always best
suited to our climate. I am also fully sensible of many of the beauties of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_2" id="Page_2">2</a></span>
the old Elizabethan houses, and also of some of the imitations of them; and
a small thatched cottage is very pretty.</p>

<p>I shall begin by stating the sort of house we want, and give a short
description of the ground on which it is proposed to build it, in order that
you may in the first place, give your notions as to the site, and the style
which you would recommend. On the style, perhaps you would give us
your views in detail, pointing out, as far as your leisure and inclination will
permit, the merits of each, and which on the whole you prefer.</p>

<p>As regards the ground, we have no park, but sufficient extent of land to
make a large paddock very park-like: it would not suit our views to
have a park: the situation is not romantic; but as the ground is poor and
wild, we shall command more ornament than profit. To the north or north-west
there is a rising terrace, well sheltered with high trees; this slopes
down for about a quarter of a mile into the valley of the Cray; the aspect is
therefore south-east, and this comes best according to the slope of the
ground. If you prefer that the house should stand high, you may have in
front a good terrace of at least two hundred yards long and eight feet high;
if lower down the hill (half way), the terrace will not be so good, but there
will be better shelter from the north wind, and at the back there will be
rising ground, through which the walks of the pleasure ground may be conducted,
and still the house will be well above the valley. In front, looking
over this valley, and across some fine orchards (for which Kent is celebrated)
and some waving fields of corn, there is a mass of wood on a rising hill, about
equal to the hill on which we are situated; on the right there is a fine view
of Knocholt beeches; in the valley there is the town of Footscray, seen
through the orchard at about half a mile distant, and by a little dexterous
cutting and levelling we shall be able to get a glimpse of the small winding
river.</p>

<p>On the right of the hill on which we are to build, there is a small spring
at present rising in some swampy ground covered with alders; this we propose
to clear, and shall be enabled, if you think it worth while, to enlarge
into a small sheet of water. With this general view, you will see that we
are well off as to aspect, have woods in the distance, and a valley (of no great
beauty indeed, but still a valley) with a quiet stream, and this is always
pleasing. I think it may be considered as a fair average specimen of
English scenery, such as is met with in the southern counties.</p>

<p>Now as regards the house. There must be a good dining-room, a good
general morning room, which will serve as drawing-room, and a large<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_3" id="Page_3">3</a></span>
library; one or two small rooms, in which to receive persons on business, &amp;c.
As regards bed-rooms, offices, &amp;c. this will be matter of future consideration,
when we have settled the important matter of site and style. I should, however,
mention, that, as circumstances may make it desirable to add to the size,
it will be advisable that there should be that irregularity in the plan as will
admit of this, so that it may be in the end, a house costing from £10,000 to
£12,000.</p>

<p>With respect to the offices, I think we make a great mistake in England,
as we manage to hide them, and lose all the benefit of increasing the size and
importance of the house by these additions. I know, however, this is a very
difficult point to manage, and merely throw it out for your consideration.</p>

<p>The general building material in this part of the country is brick, though
we are enabled, at no very great cost, to get some stone for window or door
frames, &amp;c.</p>

<p>I have been reading a little about the sites of ancient villas, but shall
not trouble you with my views until I receive your answer: recollect we
have a bad and variable climate, though we go out as much in the winter as
summer; so that there must be at once shelter from the sun for our short
summer, and warmth and shelter during the long winters and cold springs.</p>

<p class="illudrop p0">FOR your letter, accept my thanks. It is doubly flattering
to me, being a foreigner, to be commissioned to
make the designs for the country house you intend
to build. Yet while I derive great satisfaction from
the task, I am impressed with the difficulties attending
it, one of which is, that I am at present prevented
by business from discussing the matter with you in
person, and am therefore compelled to put my ideas
upon paper. Simple as the commission appears, it
however involves considerations of some moment,
and which render it necessary that I should previously state to you my
opinion in detail in regard to the style I propose to adopt. I have not
forgotten what you once said to me, namely, that in order to make himself
intelligible to others, it is essential that the artist should be clear as to his
own meaning. I even suspect that opinions once defined, if not clearly and
sincerely put down, may lead to misapprehension, and (inasmuch as they<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_5a" id="Page_5a">5</a></span>
commit the person who gives them) to the misleading of the artist himself.
You invite me, however, to give my opinion, and having freely stated the
difficulties of the undertaking, I begin with more confidence.</p>

<p>What then, with a view to your individual taste, is the style I would
recommend as most suitable for the intended situation and purpose? And if
such a question is now become not an uncommon one, you must allow that,
sixty years ago, no one would have thought of proposing it to an architect
for his consideration. Every architect would then have at once answered it
by saying, "In that style which is in general use, and according to my own
particular views of it." Or during any of the various epochs of the art,
would any one have thought of suggesting to a Greek, an Italian, or native
of the north of Europe, &amp;c. to build in any other style than that belonging to
their respective countries? It ought also to be borne in mind, that if we
occasionally meet with an intermixture of styles, it is only in buildings of
<em>transition periods</em>, during the change from one mode to another; and such
periods were of only short duration, because the previous style had already
outlived itself. Circumstances are now totally altered. We recognize and
practically adopt various styles indiscriminately: nor is it difficult to explain
how it happens that we now employ one and then another. For this, two
reasons may be assigned: the first (a very meritorious one) is, that we with
a generalizing view, anxiously study and investigate the most difficult examples
of art. The second reason however, is of a very unsatisfactory
nature, which is that in our weak hands no style has been so naturalized
among us as to constitute a permanent canon by which to regulate the modifications
of any and every architectural purpose. This is the cause of that
indecision of style which manifests itself more or less in modern edifices, and
of that changeableness of taste which has hitherto hindered us from establishing
the art upon fixed principles, regulated according to the high requisites
which our modern cultivation requires.</p>

<p>We seem to be of opinion that variety of character is attainable only by
variety of style: hence our Museums are classically <em>antique</em>, our churches
after the mode of the middle ages, and so forth, according as the buildings
happen to belong to the class in which any particular period was most distinguished
for buildings of that class. The character of such examples strikes
us by its expressiveness; nor do we find it difficult, with models before us
that we are now acquainted with and understand, to produce the same kind
of effect and expression by merely copying their physiognomy and style.
He, however, who is well grounded in the study, is aware that at different<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_6a" id="Page_6a">6</a></span>
periods the art was treated according to its own principles as resulting from
different modes of culture; and that consequently the adoption of a style
previously discarded, though it may suit the vitiated taste of the artist, as the
<em>haut gout</em> pleases the fastidious palate of the Epicure, yet it can never be
pleasing to a really cultivated taste. You may think me somewhat fantastical,
but it appears to me that we cannot read Homer with perfect relish in a
saloon à la Louis Quatorze, or Shakespeare beneath the roof of a Grecian
impluvium; and that it is only where the character of the surrounding forms
and objects in some degree accord, at least do not harshly contrast with our
mental occupation, that we can fully abandon ourselves to the imaginings of
genius. I might, however, without impropriety, substitute "<em>character</em>" for
"<em>style</em>" in the question you put to me, and my answer would then be: Let
it be as noble and as cheerful as possible. Still the making a distinction
between style and character does not entirely get rid of the difficulty; for a
person who is as intelligent as you are in matters of art will say, "Even if
you hit the character, the mere <em>desire</em> to invent an appropriate style does not
of itself satisfy me, and on this account I wish you to state more explicitly
which of former styles you intend mainly to select." This I will now attempt
to do, and begin by stating it as my opinion, that the most perfect architectural
style is that which admits at the same time of a refined style both of
sculpture and of painting:&mdash;that which, while it serves as the vehicle of
graceful embellishment, can maintain an equal excellence in itself. Such, as
it appears to me, is the ideal which an architect of the present day ought to
keep in his mind's eye. Yet before we proceed to inquire which of the
principal styles we are acquainted with possesses such a quality in the most
eminent degree, it will be proper to consider what is the kind of relationship
which the three separate arts of architecture, painting, and sculpture, bear
to each other.</p>

<p>According to the usual metaphor, the consanguinity is that of sisterhood.
Yet in my opinion this is somewhat incorrect. In its origin and development
every organic style of architecture has preceded the other two arts, consequently
the relationship in which it stands to them may more properly be
termed maternal, it being under her fostering protection that they have afterwards
grown up: nor would it be difficult to exemplify this sort of connexion
between the three arts by instances taken from different styles of architecture;
and one who has applied himself to studying the motives and principles
governing the formation of those different styles, will easily follow me in my
remarks.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_7" id="Page_7">7</a></span>The two daughter arts were unknown to, or did not exist for the earliest
Asiatic architecture; on which account, imposing as its gigantic remains are,
they oppress the mind by the feeling they excite of stern and monstrous vastness.
In the Egyptian style the growth of the children arts appears to have
been stunted and repressed by the servitude in which they were kept; nor
have any later race or nation attempted to rival the massiveness of its edifices,
tattooed over with hieroglyphics.</p>

<p>It is only in the genuine architecture of ancient Greece itself, and in the
Italian style of the fifteenth century, that we meet with all the three arts
growing up to completeness together, and as is universally acknowledged,
brought to a very high degree of refinement and perfection.</p>

<p>Notwithstanding the long continued progressive formation and manifold
development of Gothic architecture, that style failed to attach to, and as it
were to incorporate with itself the two kindred arts, which were checked both
by unfavourableness of climate, and by war and political disturbances. Architecture
was therefore compelled to trust chiefly to its own power and
resources, employing sculpture and painting merely as subordinate decoration.
And who shall say that this style, so full of creative power, would not have
preserved itself more pure, have avoided falling into the cold and gloomy on
the one hand, the bizarre and overloaded on the other, could it have availed
itself of the assistance of sculpture and painting, so that they should have
accompanied it in all the varieties of its times and developments? This was
to an extent the case with Arabian architecture,<a name="FNanchor_1" id="FNanchor_1"></a><a href="#Footnote_1" class="fnanchor">[1]</a> which, both in regard to the
dominion it obtained and its organization, has many points of similarity with
the nearly contemporary Gothic style, notwithstanding the marked distinctions
which prevail between them. This reminds me of the remark of a poetical
friend, who once said to me, "Like a rainbow on the horizon of art, Gothic
architecture stretches itself across Europe from Byzantium to Portugal;
while Arabian architecture may be compared to its reflection, somewhat
flattened however, commencing from the same point, and crossing along the
north coast of Africa till it reaches Spain: or to a reflection in the water,
whose wavy surface occasions some little difference of appearance; and in
fact we behold both styles united together in the amphibious city of Venice."<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_8" id="Page_8">8</a></span>
This simile would be more literally appropriate had the uses to which the
two styles were applied been more nearly alike.</p>

<div class="footnote">
<p class="footnote"><a name="Footnote_1" id="Footnote_1"></a><a href="#FNanchor_1"><span class="label">[1]</span></a> As regards <em>Arabian architecture</em>, the parent art may be said to have been entirely
childless, depending entirely on its own resources, discarding all representation of animal life,
whether in painting or sculpture.</p>
</div>

<p>With respect to modern architecture, it may be said that it has quite
rejected the services of the other two arts, and, as I fear, greatly to its own
detriment; while these latter arts, notwithstanding the eminence they have
attained apart from architecture, are not so solidly united as they otherwise
would be, nor capable of so completely developing their powers, had the
union of the three been complete.</p>

<p>It is well known that, owing to the fetters imposed upon them in Egypt
by the religion of the people and its priesthood, it was only in Europe that
sculpture and painting could at different epochs attain to maturity. But it
is not perhaps so generally known or considered, that it is one characteristic
mark of European architecture, that it has at all times, whether those of its
progress and advancement, or its decline, availed itself of natural forms, both
vegetable and animal, for purposes of decoration; while the Asiatic styles
were confined to geometrical figures for the ornaments.</p>

<p>The above cursory glance at the history of the art, may at least serve to
shew how incumbent it is upon the architect of the present day to make
himself acquainted with the creative power and processes of his art, by
studying them as they actually manifest themselves at different epochs, and
according to the different views and purposes to which the art was applied.
By so doing, however, he is in some danger of being worked upon by conflicting
impressions, occasioned by the diversity of styles and the opposite
tastes they exhibit. Yet, unless I am greatly mistaken, the whole system of
the art, as developed in the different styles, must henceforth have considerable
influence upon our modern architecture.</p>

<p>Limiting our views for the present to those architectural productions in
which a union with the other arts is more directly attainable, we find Grecian
or early Italian architecture the predominating style. The last grafted on the
former, may be said to be more or less complete in the greater or less proportion
in which it derives its nourishment from the parent stem. If we look,
for example, to the progress or course of painting in Italy, that art flourished
there in proportion to the nourishment it derived from the antique. The
works of Mantegna, M. Angelo, Leonardo da Vinci, and Raphael bear testimony
to this; and those great men would probably have attained to a higher
degree of excellence, had they been as well acquainted with the sculptures of
the Parthenon, and the Greek bronzes, as they were with the works of the
Romans. Most assuredly a knowledge of the architecture of the time of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_9" id="Page_9">9</a></span>
Pericles, or of that of Pompey, would not have been without its influence
upon such men as Bramante, San Gallo, and Baldassore Peruzzi, nor have
failed of being turned to account by them: observe, however, that this
remark is not intended to depreciate what they actually accomplished, nor
to disparage the style which they formed. These explorers had unquestionably
discovered new veins in the rich mine which had been opened by
the Greeks; as the Romans, who were the immediate imitators of the Greeks,
had already extended the one first of all worked. In all subsequent operations,
as in what the French term the <em>Renaissance</em> style, nothing more was
done than to go on excavating, seldom, however, with sufficient pains or
caution, so as to separate completely the gold from the dross. When, therefore,
I propose to make a design in the "Greek style," I wish you to observe
that I understand by this term a striving after the purity of this canon, but
at the same time with a reserved right to the free use of those modes and
motives with which later European architecture supplies us. If a determinate
name must be given to the style, I propose I should call it, "the
Renaissance style of the nineteenth century."</p>

<p>But many may say, "How conveniently he contrives to get rid of the
Gothic architecture!" while others will exclaim, "According to such principles,
a very pretty sort of medley is likely to be produced." In answer to
the first set of objections I reply: "If you can introduce modern sculpture
and painting into Gothic architecture without prejudice to <em>them</em> or <em>it</em>, I will
say that you have attained a great end." To the others I should reply:
"You misunderstand or pervert my meaning. I have not spoken of a merely
mixing up of different styles, but of compounding them together; between
which two processes there is, I conceive, a wide difference, the ingredients
being merely put together in the one case, without losing their respective
qualities; while in the other they amalgamate with each other, and produce
an entirely new combination: and it is in accomplishing combinations of this
kind that the power of genuine art manifests itself; and the distinction may
be likened to the difference between a mechanical and a chemical combination.
Nor are some compound styles of architecture less beautiful than
others which are quite unmixed."</p>

<p>I know not whether these remarks will prove of much service to you, but
I trust they will at least enable you, after seeing what are my views generally
on the subject, to make your own suggestions in return for my further
guidance.</p>

<p class="smcap">
Dear Sir,
</p>

<div style="width: 167px;">
<img class="drop" src="images/i_018b.png" width="167" height="170" alt="Illustrated drop cap letter T" />
</div>

<p class="illudrop p0">THANKS for your letter in answer to mine,
or rather in part answer to it, for you have
confined yourself solely to a discussion of the
style to be selected. A subject which has
hitherto, I think, not been sufficiently considered;
at least in England. I believe that
amateurs order a Grecian Palladian, or Elizabethan
house without having much speculated
on what are the different merits or demerits of
each, but merely with reference to some one
example which may be in their recollection,
and which may have pleased them; or what is oftener the case, they submit
to be guided by the bent of their architect, who in general, are wedded to
some particular favourite style. Thus, we have Mr. &mdash;&mdash;, all Gothic and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_11" id="Page_11">11</a></span>
Elizabethan; Mr. &mdash;&mdash;, all Italian, with a dash of the Byzantine, Renaissance,
&amp;c.</p>

<p>I am, I own, much pleased as well as instructed by this discussion, and
I hope you will not consider me as intruding too much upon your time and
patience, if I venture to seek further elucidations of some of the positions in
your letter. I quite agree it is clear that as yet we have a style to choose,
and that in future ages, no architect will be able to apply any definite character
to our present mode of building. I must, however, premise what indeed
my letter will fully prove, that your partiality has induced you to give me
credit for greater knowledge in matters of art, especially as regards architecture,
than I possess.</p>

<p>I agree that the style which best admits of being combined with the sister
arts (or filial if you please) of painting and sculpture, must be the one to
adopt, and that it is clear their union is always a mutual improvement. It
seems you come to the conclusion that the pure Greek style of architecture is
that which best admits of this union. Now, as regards domestic architecture,
I am not sure that I have any very clear perception of what is pure Greek
style. I suspect our notion as regards a house of pure Greek style, is a
cube of building of mock stone with a portico, if a large house; or if a small
one, with some thin paste-like pilasters, and a certain number of parallelogram
holes cut into the walls for windows, with two smaller cubes for wings; and,
in the inside, a repetition of the outside, in the shape of the rooms; that is,
two oblong rooms for dining and drawing rooms, with an oblong hall placed
the other way: the usual accompaniment of folding doors, and two or three
small and often dark rooms at the back. There are certainly some changes
rung on these forms, but the theme is always the same. I call Sir R. Smirties'
Post Office a gigantic small Grecian house. I am aware that the Palladian
improvements, or additions, (which ever you will) have multiplied the resources,
and have given us much to delight; namely, the circular dome,
pillars, and gallery, and the consequent change in the disposition of the
apartments. I mention these points to let you see the nakedness of the land,
and trust to your kindness for better instruction.</p>

<p>You assume that the Grecian style is the best adapted to pictorial and
sculptural decoration, but I do not see the reason of this; in fact, without a
more precise definition of what you mean by Greek style, as adapted to domestic
architecture, I do not see how this can be shewn. You state that the
Gothic style is not so well adapted to the union with the filial arts, and that
hitherto when so used they were subordinate only. I shall be the more ready<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_12" id="Page_12">12</a></span>
to agree when I have some further exposition on this point. Though not so
distrustful as our Royal Society who adopt "<i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Nullius in verba</i>" as their motto,
yet cling to an old monkish law maxim of Lord Coke; I may say of your
position what he says of law, "<i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Lex plus laudatur quando ratione probatur</i>."
I am aware that the Gothic churches are often overloaded with ornament, and
that the sculpture often seems as if merely stuck on, and the pictures are
hung up as ornaments, not as part and parcel of the building; and, I believe,
that tapestry was often called in aid to decorate our cathedrals, and with
great effect; but is it of necessity so? Are there no exceptions? at all events,
it is not so in the Byzantine style, which approaches so nearly to the Gothic;
and, as regards the Arabian, (take for instance the Alhambra) the fair daughters
unite in great harmony with their beautiful mother. You have besides
omitted, I think, one point in which Gothic architecture has been greatly
aided by the pictorial art, namely, the painted windows:</p>

<div class="poem-container">
<div class="poem">
<span class="i0">With hues romantic tinged the gorgeous pane,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">To fill with holy light this wondrous fane,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">To aid the builder's model richly rude,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">By no Vitruvian symmetry subdued.</span>
</div>
</div>

<p>I begin to feel that it is probable I have entirely mistaken what you mean
by Grecian style, and that it does not preclude the use of arches, groined
ceilings, domes, &amp;c. I have been the more diffuse on this point because I
own I have a leaning to what we have called <span class="smcap">Elizabethan</span>; conceiving,
whether true or not, that there is more fitness in it for domestic architecture
than in the Grecian style; that the regularity and repetition of form,
which in a great building is delightful, in a small one does not please from
the diminutive size of the objects. And, again, as regards the material and
colour, as we use Grecian style in this country, the material is either white
stone or white stucco, which in our climate appears cold, and does not give
half so much the notion of warmth and comfort as the fine rich-toned red
brick; and what refers to the exterior, is perhaps equally applicable to the
interior. Although in a building on a grand scale the mind is pleased with
symmetry and regularity, "in little" this is irksome, and gives the notion of
poverty, in fact, too soon lets you into the secret of the whole house; there
is no surprise, no discovery to make. Shew me a Palladian villa a mile
off, and I could draw you the plan of the inside at once. Indeed, I could
walk blindfolded into the drawing-room, dining-room, library, and boudoir,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_13" id="Page_13">13</a></span>
and go up to bed in the best bed-room, without a guide, or a light. Here
are no</p>

<div class="poem-container">
<div class="poem">
<span class="i0">Rich windows that exclude the light,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And passages that lead to nothing.</span>
</div>
</div>

<p>A good deal also, I am willing to own, arises from association and national
prejudices; some of our most delightful houses are built in this style, and
they have, at all events within, signs of harmony in the style of decoration,
and in the accessories. The gardens and out-buildings were often made more
appropriate and better suited to the house than in any other architectural
attempts that we have made; and, I believe, no Englishman ever fancied
building a house that did not have the large bay window and the large fireplace
(against all principles of good grates and Arnott's stoves I admit,) and
the low groined passage and the panelled hall in his mind. But it seems
you think it most difficult</p>

<div class="poem-container">
<div class="poem">
<span class="i0">&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;"To reconcile<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The willing graces to the Gothic pile,"</span>
</div>
</div>

<p class="p0">or rather say coy than willing. I beg you will not suppose I am opposing
your views, all I mean is to canvass and to be sure that I understand them.</p>

<p>I have to repeat that I agree entirely that the style is best which is most
susceptible of uniting the three arts; but I only wish to know why the Greek
is most susceptible; and what is the kind of sculpture and painting you wish
to unite; in order to see that such a union is suitable to our climate, and can
be obtained at a reasonable cost, for you must bear in mind that I want to
build a country-house, not a palace!</p>

<p>It is a long time since I was in Italy, and when I was there I did not pay
so much attention to architecture as I should do, if I were to go over the
same ground again, now that I have got a house to build; but there is a strong
impression on my mind that the other parts of Europe may rival or surpass
us in palaces and grand architectural monuments, yet that there is no country
which would present so many good hints in domestic architecture as England;
always referring to the great points, convenience, and comfort; for I own, as
<em>fitness</em> is the guiding principles of all perfection in building, I conceive it
essential in purely domestic architecture, that a character of fitness for habitation
and comfort should always be prominent.</p>

<p>I am a great admirer of Balzac, and I think one of his best descriptions of
still life is the account of the house in his "Recherche de l'absolu;" it is so<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_14" id="Page_14">14</a></span>
good that I should be tempted, if it were not too long for a letter, to copy
and send it to you as a model, if not of what a house should be, at least of
how one should be described.<a name="FNanchor_2" id="FNanchor_2"></a><a href="#Footnote_2" class="fnanchor">[2]</a></p>

</div>

<p class="illudrop p0">BUT for the trouble of answering your letter I should
have been much amused by your remarks upon what,
at no very distant period, used to pass for Grecian
architecture; but thank heaven we have passed over
that barren tract of human invention. Continuing
in the same strain, you would fain have me believe
you are one of those pilgrims to the shrine of art,
who fancy they have now luckily gained a verdant
and flowery oasis; or rather that they have discovered
the true Eden itself, which it seems is no other than
the Elizabethan style; and to complete all, you treat me as the evil spirit,
harbouring deadly enmity against this fair paradise.</p>

<p>It is easy enough for you to give your opinions off-hand on these matters,
but with us the case is different: the architect finds it less difficult to exhibit
his ideas in his design, than to explain all the motives which lead to it,&mdash;how
the ideas exactly arose, and how far they may have been influenced, either by
our studies or our fancy. I must be allowed, therefore, to return to my<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_16" id="Page_16">16</a></span>
former examination of the subject of style, and my deduction from such
examination.</p>

<p>You will call to mind that the principal different manners which have
prevailed in Europe, are, first the Greek style, and the additions made to it
by the Roman adaptation of it, then the Gothic in its different periods, and
the different treatments of such periods in the different countries; and under
this period may be added the partial adoption of the Arabian style in the
south. Then this great æra of the revival or Renaissance style, as it seemingly
arose in Italy, France, Germany, Flanders, and England. This being,
as regards England, your boasted Elizabethan style.</p>

<p>It is only very recently that my attention has been bestowed on that style
which in the north of Europe succeeded to the Gothic; whereas, till then,
it had been all along imagined that the Italians alone had comprehended the
spirit of the antique, and been able to revive it in a newer form of their own;
an error against which we should be upon our guard. Why should we not
recognize the various modes of treating the antique, as we find them in different
countries; and admit them to be all emanations from one common source
and principle. In like manner, the Gothic principle or style was in common
adopted and worked out through the whole of Europe, and was in common
consentaneously abandoned wherever it had flourished; and the elements of
ancient architecture became as commonly substituted for it. And this abandonment
of the Gothic, it may be remarked, is the first instance in all history,
when the creative power of a people (and, by people, I do not mean a single
nation, but the whole of Christendom, united by one common religion) has
survived the style of architecture, originally invented and brought to perfection
by themselves.</p>

<p>This last subject would be an interesting and fertile one to investigate,
and would throw considerable light on the development of the human mind
throughout Europe. Such consideration, even confined merely as regards
architecture, would be one too far from the present subject now to discuss.
Since, however, the Gothic as well as the revival of the antique principle have
extended over all Europe, in order to attain a knowledge of either, we should
not confine ourselves to isolated specimens of particular countries. It is only
by taking a survey of the entire field of Gothic architecture, that we can rightly
comprehend its varied powers. Is it possible I would ask, from the mere
acquaintance with English Gothic to imagine, or from its elements to compose
a tower like that of the Minster of Freiburg in Brisgau, or a loggia of similar
character to that called the Loggia da Orcagna, at Florence? On the other<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_17" id="Page_17">17</a></span>
hand an acquaintance with continental Gothic alone will furnish no idea of
the peculiar character of the English perpendicular class. The Renaissance
style which is fraught with so much plasticity and variety, springs also but
from one root. In like manner as it is impossible for a botanist to understand
all the species of one particular family without tracing all that are found in
different parts of the globe; so too, is it impossible to become acquainted
with the power of any one style of architecture without a similar comparative
study of all its specimens, as exhibited in the works of different nations which
have adopted it. To the north of Europe must justly be allowed the merit of
having exhausted the whole circuit of Gothic architecture, and the application
of its principles; this was certainly not accomplished in Italy. It is therefore
on this side of the Alps that we observe many of the motives and principles
of the Gothic retained to a very late period not disturbed, as was the case in
Italy, by types from the antique. At the same time it must be admitted, that
when the style founded upon this latter, began to find its way northwards,
the two sister arts, painting and sculpture, though they followed in the train
of architecture, did not strike root very deeply, but were for the most part
treated capriciously and mechanically as mere handicrafts; and this was
especially the case in England. It is therefore remarked with some truth, that
the Renaissance style is characterized in Italy by greater delicacy and beauty
than elsewhere; in France and the Low countries by greater richness, and in
England by capriciousness and extravagance. Lest, however, the term itself,
Renaissance, should be thought too loose and vague, it may be proper to
define it as used to signify "that style which everywhere succeeded immediately
to the Gothic."</p>

<p>In Italy, this first period of the proper application of the antique terminates
with the tendency of Michael Angelo, to destroy the true proportions
of his buildings by colossal details; on the other parts of the continent it disappeared
in consequence of the diffusion of M. Angelo's taste by the Jesuits;
and in England it terminated at the time of Wren. Accordingly, this architectural
period extends very little beyond a single century, commencing in
other countries about the time when it was already on the decline in Italy.</p>

<p>In what I have just been stating, I must be understood to allude to one
uniform aim, namely, the free appropriation and adaptation of the elements
of the antique style to modern purposes; consequently it is evident that the
so-called Elizabethan style is only one of the links of a progressive series of
such attempts. You must, therefore, admit that architecture which is capable
of producing independent works out of its own resources, and from its own<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_18" id="Page_18">18</a></span>
principles, is degraded to what is little better than mere decoration and scene
painting, when, (apprehensive of falling into contradiction and want of harmony,
unless it retains all the individual particulars of extant examples,) it
timidly strives to imitate the dialect of a single province. How short a time,
however, must the impression produced by such mummery last! and how
long the impression of a work of architecture is destined to remain! It is because
we are ashamed of, or mistrust the results of our own study and conviction,
that we venture to exhibit ourselves to posterity, merely as the copyists
of examples; the repute of which is already established, and which may be
learnt and repeated by rote? At various periods men have shewn themselves
either barbarous or puerile in their notions on art; yet never till now such
slavish copyists, such mere plagiarists, such mocking-birds in style. You may
judge by this sally in what an ill humour I am, at finding that you would
shut me up in a cage and there make me sing. If you examine your Elizabethan
architecture with some little critical attention, you will hardly fail to
perceive that, with all its richness of expression, the elementary sounds are
no more harmonious than the crowing of a cock, or the braying of an ass.</p>

<p>All this concerns merely the <span class="smcap">style</span>, as style; for in other respects we
often meet with much that deserves praise; convenient arrangement, and contrivance,
striking effect, and much cleverness of construction and execution,
although so far from being pure or refined, the taste displayed may be decidedly
vulgar and coarse. I freely confess that the merits I have just mentioned,
were retained in the architecture of the north of Europe during the
sixteenth and seventeenth centuries: I say retained, because the Gothic style
that was then abandoned, had been treated with masterly and skill, and shewed
disciplined artificers in all that belongs to mechanical execution; consequently,
the ability thus produced had only to employ itself upon a fresh task.
At the end of the last century, on the contrary, so completely had every thing
like a school of the art disappeared, that at the University of Gottingen,
architecture was taught as supplementary to the elementary course of mathematics.
Is it then to be wondered at that we should have been filled with
stupid wonder at the sublime works then newly brought to light, or that we
should have set about copying them for the nonce, out of the affectation of
classical purity, but without bestowing any study on the peculiar motives to
be detected in them, or on the necessary alterations to be made in consequence
of new exigences?</p>

<p>If we allow that as far as it proceeded, Grecian architecture is stamped
by perfect beauty, it is of little moment to our argument whether it was so<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_19" id="Page_19">19</a></span>
comprehensive as it might have been, and had sufficiently developed itself
for those purposes which we now more especially require; since the perfection
it did actually attain in the direction it took, ought to be sufficient to
inspire the artist. It was not necessary that the latter should surrender up
the freedom belonging to him as such, and confine himself to following
Grecian motives and intentions. In fact, the peculiar charm,&mdash;the grace and
freshness of Grecian architecture become withered as soon as we begin to
treat it according to dry systematic rules. The Vitruvius, capable of legislating
for it according to its genius and true spirit perhaps is not yet born!
For indulging at such length in these somewhat abstract remarks upon style
alone, I must again entreat your pardon. You ask for some more distinct
and explicit ideas on the subject; and are apparently, like many others, of
opinion, that the remains of a few temples, such as we behold in Stuart and
Revett, comprise nearly the whole of Greek architecture. The chief point
for our present consideration is, how far it had accommodated itself to
buildings for domestic purposes: and here I must remind you that Pliny's
description of his villas are still extant. It must, indeed, be confessed that
those two residences do not belong to the epoch of Pericles; yet they belong
nevertheless to that same series of actual Greek plans and constructions
which have been preserved to us at Pompeii and Herculaneum, and which
Sir W. Gell's tasteful delineations have rendered so familiar to all. Many
remains of the same class in the vicinity of Rome, and more especially in the
Golfo di Gaeta, at Puzzoli, and in the environs of Naples, sufficiently attest
the fancy and variety with which the ancients availed themselves of the
conditions imposed by peculiarities of ground and locality,&mdash;contrived to
combine the advantages of coolness and shade on the one hand, with the
glow of sunshine on the other; to provide a frame and foreground for the
prospect from the house; and to produce happily imagined effects and picturesqueness
of character by means of the irregularity and declivity of the
ground.</p>

<p>Each of those ancient villas presents us with a new idea, and may be
taken as an architectural study. Look, for instance, at those examples of the
kind on the Lake of Albano and the Gulf of Gaëta, where the dwelling itself
is connected with grottoes offering cool retreats, either for sitting in or for
the purpose of baths, and upon entering which the visitor is so fascinated by
the magic effect of reflected light from the water, that he almost fancies the
whole scene to be a visionary and unearthly one. Water, it may be observed,
either gushing in a stream, or exhibiting an expanded mirror-like<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_20" id="Page_20">20</a></span>
surface, appears to have been considered by the ancients indispensable to the
charm of a villa residence. In both the destroyed cities, even the smallest
town houses offered upon entering them the reflection of the sky on the
surface of the water contained in the basin of the impluvium. In larger
dwellings, water was introduced more abundantly, and also in greater variety
of modes; and residences upon the coast were built out quite into the sea.
Besides much else that they have derived from the ancients, the modern
Italians have retained this fondness for the combination of water and architecture,
as many of their villas testify. For examples of the kind I refer you
to the Villa Madama near Rome, and also to several at Frescati; and yet
there the water and the architecture are not so intimately connected as in the
villas and houses of the ancients. The climate of the north, in a great measure,
prevents our availing ourselves of water as a means of producing reflection
of light in the interior; but we may imitate this principle in a due
arrangement of light and shade, and also in some cases by the use of mirrors
in place of water.</p>

<p>Another very great, though little regarded point of excellence and architectural
effect in the latter consists in the covered ambulatories and porticoes,
which, indeed, were intended chiefly as a defence against heat and sun, yet
recommend themselves equally to us, as affording protection from rain and
wind. Nevertheless it is rarely but in cloisters that we find this architectural
convenience retained. Great attention seems also to have been paid by the
ancients to planning the internal communication in such a manner, that the
domestics could pass to and fro, and have access to the different rooms,
without incommoding those occupying any of the suite; and in this sort of
arrangement they frequently exhibit so much ingenuity and contrivance, that
we may study for some time ere we shall be able to surpass them.</p>

<p>For the present, these few hints and suggestions must suffice; but I could
discourse to you for days together of the varied effects of light, the manifold
diversity of form, the richness of play in regard to decoration, and all the
combinations and beauties, both with respect to circumstances of locality and
arrangement, that are to be met with in the remains of ancient domestic
architecture.</p>

<p>Among other questions which you have submitted for my consideration,
is, whether pure Greek architectural forms and details will bear to be united
with such a material as coloured brickwork? And by way of removing your
doubts, I beg to remind you of the highly praised brick edifices of King
Mausolus, described by Vitruvius. Texture and colour of materials are to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_21" id="Page_21">21</a></span>
be considered merely as the vehicle made use of by the artist, and may be
employed in one style almost equally as well as in another. Another doubt
suggested, is whether arches and vaulting can properly be admitted into
the style above-named? Now, were you to consult the Delphic oracle, it
would probably return you some such answer as the following: <em>When the
edge of an aperture in a wall forms a right angle, the archivolt may still
descend to the base without being interrupted by an impost. In vaulting, the
diagonal crossing lines must be considered as secondary ones.</em></p>

<p>Perhaps this will but ill satisfy you, and you will say that, instead of
solving one enigma, I have merely added another. Yet of one thing you
may be assured, namely, that those difficult problems and mysteries in art,
which have been expounded in formal terms, have been already actually
decyphered, and explained more clearly by the practical solution of them in
productions of art.</p>

<p>It seems you think I have not yet given you any satisfactory reason for
my position, that the present improved state, both of painting and sculpture,
renders it difficult to reconcile them with the conditions required by Gothic
architecture. I admit this would be otherwise were we to go back to the
hard dry style of the Van Eyck school. I can only say that such an attempt
has been made by some of the best artists in Germany, and that after persisting
in the trial for some time, they have now abandoned the imitation of
the early German style, and have preferred the Italian. At any rate, my
opinion is not contradicted by history, since the latter informs us that the
powerful impression produced by the broad handling and simple masses of
the ancient works of sculpture, then first discovered in various parts of Italy,
had the effect of giving the representation of nature an entirely new direction.
It is also a striking circumstance that, owing to the fresh impulse
which both painting and sculpture hence received, not only the taste for
Gothic architecture declined, but the system itself was opposed both by
painters and sculptors, who attempted to make architecture subsidiary to
their productions. Such being the case, as they alleged, in regard to ancient
art. With what eagerness not only the learned men of Italy, and the
architects who were urged on by them to the study of classical antiquity,
but also both sculptors and painters, entered the lists against Gothic art, is
sufficiently evident from Ghiberti's journal; and again afterwards, when a
decided victory had been already obtained over it, from Raphael's report to
Leo X. on the ancient edifices and other remains at Rome.</p>

<p>It is perhaps not so generally known, that in more northern countries it<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_22" id="Page_22">22</a></span>
was the painters who set up for reformers in architecture. Holbein, there is
reason to think, erected the first specimen of the antique in England: the
portal of Wilton House, for his patron the Earl of Pembroke, still existing.
About a hundred years later, Rubens, with the view of giving the death-blow
to the still lingering taste for Gothic architecture in the Netherlands, made
drawings of the Palaces of Genoa, and caused them to be disseminated in
engravings. At the present day, indeed, we may be excused for smiling at
the classical zeal of the worthy Peter Paul, who, in his preface to that collection
of designs, inveighs against Gothic architecture as barbarous, at the
same time that the plates themselves which he gives, are little better than
hideous caricatures of the modern Genoese style, which, at the best is by no
means remarkable for purity of taste.</p>

<p>Should Gothic architecture, which is just now employed upon a liberal
scale, and with more or less of true feeling for it, in your country ever obtain
firm footing there again, depend upon it my professional brethren who have,
I think, adopted it without due consideration of the present condition of the
other fine arts, will have to encounter serious, and, perhaps, unforeseen difficulties
from the painters and sculptors. Were some gifted sculptor to apply
himself to architecture, I am persuaded he would drive us all out of the field,
for the charm with which that art is capable of investing architecture by a
skilful union of the flesh-like sculpture with the hard bones of architecture,
would produce an irresistibly fascinating effect.</p>

<p>From this long letter you will collect that, whilst on the other hand I do
not mean to be confined either to a servile imitation of a pure Pompeian house;
so, on the other, I do not mean to be tied down to repeat your Elizabethan
architecture, or the Gothic of Germany or England. Nor do I propose to
give you a fac-simile of any building of the Renaissance school. To the best
of my power, I propose (as the best style) that which adopts the pure broad
principles of beauty in building, and which were, I sincerely believe, best propounded
by the Greeks; and which all experience has shewn to be best suited
to receive addition from the highest style of painting and sculpture; and which
are, in fact, parts of architecture. How far I may succeed is another point.</p>

<p>It is indeed difficult in all cases, even to select what is best; but with the
most lofty aspirations, I am aware that I may indeed fall very short of the
execution of my wishes; perhaps, I have already done myself some harm
in this very discussion of style, by preparing you to expect too much.</p>

Dear Sir,
</p>

<div style="width: 167px;">
<img class="drop" src="images/i_018b.png" width="167" height="170" alt="Illustrated drop cap letter T" />
</div>

<p class="illudrop p0">THE letter you send in answer to mine, on the
question of the most preferable style, I must
allow, contains many good reasons in support
of your opinion and views; and laying aside
prejudice and early associations, I am willing
to admit that it is wise to adopt that style
which possesses the most completely the elements
of beauty, and which is most susceptible
of being united to painting and
sculpture, essential accessories of architecture,
or rather, important branches of that art. Some of the facts which you
mention are very interesting and striking, indeed, convincing; and the more
I have reflected on the subject, the more I feel the advantage of breadth,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_24" id="Page_24">24</a></span>
and the superior beauty of the simple and grand lines of Grecian architecture;
and my curiosity to see the mode in which you will follow out your
precepts by your example, is hourly increasing, although I am quite aware
that one specimen of a building will not be sufficient to illustrate the general
positions you have, I think, so well established.</p>

<p>I almost wish that you had been tempted to extend your letter, already
long, for the purpose of entering still further into a subject of such interest.
I should be curious to learn to what extent the arts of painting and sculpture
had been applied, in conjunction with the Gothic; and where they had most
failed, and to ascertain whether those instances fully corroborate your positions.
As regards your oracular distinction between the two styles, I am not sure I
quite understand you. I shall, however, leave this till the termination of the
discussion of the plan. The merits of the arrangements and contrivances of
the ancient villas, as ascertainable from the descriptions extant, and the plans
of those of Pompeii had not entirely escaped me. In addition to the published
information, I recollect to have received, many years since, much information
and instruction on the subject from Mr. Cocherell, soon after his return
from Italy; he having devoted much attention to the arrangement of ancient
villas, and having selected some very interesting materials to illustrate the
ingenuity of the contrivances, and the judicious selection of the sites, &amp;c.</p>

<p>Every part of your letter is tantalizing, and makes me regret that you
have merely touched on subjects of such deep interest; whilst reading it, I
forgot that I had commissioned you to give me the plan of a house, not to
write a complete treatise on ancient and modern architecture. Conceding to
you the choice of the style, convinced by your reasons and arguments in
favour of its superior beauty and capability, I own to you I do so reluctantly,
not without a sigh, and not without much hesitation. Although, abstractedly,
a building constructed on the principles you advocate, may have more
beauty than our own Gothic or Elizabethan, and may be more susceptible of
a union of the three arts; yet there is one part of the subject to which you
have not adverted, and on which, perhaps, you are not likely to feel so
strongly as we do in England, the most aristocratic country in the world.
Some of our most beautiful houses are in this the rejected style, and with
them are connected all the prejudices and associations of antiquity, of ancestral
dignity and greatness; and a house of this kind carries the mind back to other
times, and awakens recollections that it has been enjoyed by a long line of
ancestry, and hence, perhaps, has in a great degree arisen the desire of many
who have built modern houses, to imitate those of the elder time; not indeed<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_25" id="Page_25">25</a></span>
from any attempt actually to devise and construct a forgery, but to avail
themselves to a certain degree of the associations to be derived from the
recollections associated with the buildings of former ages, and in the construction
of which, at least, the most skill and talent had been employed; and
again perhaps, the very clumsy and unsuccessful adaptation of the principles
of the revived Grecian and Roman, or Palladian architecture, to our modern
houses, (especially in the smaller ones,) may have tended to keep alive the
prejudice in favour of that style, which even if it were not the best, was at
least the best executed; more especially in its adaptation to the fitness of
domestic arrangements and comfort. Whilst I have been advocating the merits
of our Elizabethan houses, you must not suppose I refer to the multitudes of
grotesque little villas which grow up every summer round London; or to
those alterations and adaptations, by which one sees Gothic spires, plastered
over with stucco, starting up out of one half of an old farm house; the walls
notched into battlements, and uncouth animals set a grinning against each
other over the gate posts, and the hall crammed and fortified with rusty swords
and pikes of all ages and fashions. And on the other half, Venetian windows
slices of pilasters, balustrades, and other parts of Italian architecture. Although
I have not such a greedy appetite for every thing Gothic, as Horace Walpole
had, yet I own I partake somewhat of his feelings, as expressed in a letter
from Stowe, when he says, "The Grecian Temple is glorious, this, I openly
worship, but in the heretical corner of my heart I adore the Gothic building."
Though I own the character he gives of the Gothic building he so adores is
barbarous enough, for he says, "That some unusual inspiration of Gibbs has
made it <em>pure</em> and venerable, with a propensity to the Venetian, or Moresque
Gothic; and the great column near it puts me in mind of the Place of St.
Mark." Strawberry Hill, however, is a sufficient proof of his knowledge and
taste for pure Gothic. There is one point on which I entirely agree, which
is that the style of decoration should be consistent with the style of the architecture.
I think we have been more deficient in attention to the style of
decoration, than even to the choice of the style of the building itself;
and nothing is now more common than to plaster the walls of a modern
London house with the Gothic paper of Henry VII.'s Chapel, and to fill it
with a load of old carving of all ages and times; and to finish with a cartload
of Louis XIV.'s clocks, and other similar ornaments: but of this, more
when we come to discuss the decoration of your rooms.</p>

</div>

<p class="illudrop p0">BY my first letter you will see I have explained to you the
<em>site</em>, and I think the next point which we have to settle
will be the advantages and disadvantages of <em>aspect</em>;
and whether the house should be placed at the top of
the low hill I have mentioned to you, or half way down,
or at the bottom. I think in general, the modern
fashion has been to seek a lofty spot, without reference
to shelter; so that the architect's work should shew well
to the surrounding country. My object is that the
house should be placed in the most convenient spot
as to <em>shelter</em>, with the best aspect suitable to our uncertain climate, always<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_27" id="Page_27">27</a></span>
taking care that there be sufficient drainage, an essential, though often a
neglected point.</p>

<p>Having explained the essential, I come next, to the ornamental; I do not
think it is so necessary that the house should form a handsome feature of the
surrounding landscape, as that it should form an harmonious picture in combination
with the grounds in immediate connexion with it; I must refer you
again to a description of the <em>locale</em>. I have nothing to add to this. You
will see that the spot I have chosen has somewhat of an amphitheatrical
shape, and that I have the means of making a terrace; that I am well backed
at the north by trees and hill, and open well to the south-east. You have
the choice of aspect within the range of south-east to south-west; yet the
house, for meteorological reasons, should not be placed too low down in the
valley. I refer you to Mr. Professor Daniell's essays on the subject of the
difference of temperature between the top and bottom of a hill; this, though
it applies principally to the position of a garden, has some weight even in
the site of a house.</p>

<p>It will be necessary that the approach should be from the south-west;
and as regards plantations and protection from wood, I am well defended on
all sides. I had meant to have added some observations on the <em>picturesque</em>,
of which we fancy we are the discoverers; but at present, I have not time.
I may, perhaps, (if I find you inclined to enter into the subject,) send a few
remarks on this; particularly, as I believe it is considered that the ancients
did not, in the situations of their houses or buildings, consult those principles
of taste which we call the picturesque. I think Dr. Copplestone, in his lectures
on ancient poetry, states this, and yet one should judge otherwise, from
seeing the sites of many of the Roman buildings in this country. That at
Bignor in Sussex is particularly beautiful, nay, grand; but yet it was low:
perhaps, the advantage of a running stream was the general cause in former
times of building quite down in the valley.</p>

<p>I think it will be an object to have as much veranda as possible, closed
in and very wide, but not, perhaps, in front of the best windows; but somewhere
so as to have both a shaded and a winter's sheltered walk.</p>

<p>I must apologize for the indefiniteness of this letter, but I think I have
given enough to serve as a text for the answer. The style and site settled,
I propose we should at once come to materials to be used, ground plan and
elevation. As regards offices, I will mention such as are essential; as you
may, in consideration of the plan, like to know this; there will be one small
lodge at the entrance on the south-west, and should have no objection to a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_28" id="Page_28">28</a></span>
back entrance at the north; as this may be used as a labourer's cottage.
There will be a double coach-house, stables for six horses; a small ice-house
and gardener's cottage. The two latter may be arranged so as to form part
of the garden wall. I mean the kitchen garden, which will be at some small
distance from the house, at the back, or north; but I mean it to be connected
with the house by the flower-garden and plantations.</p>

Dear Sir,

</div>

<p class="illudrop p0">WE come now to fix upon a part of the grounds that shall
appear most healthy, neither too confined nor too exposed;
commanding a good prospect, yet well sheltered.
This is a very material point, and not indeed altogether
free from difficulty; nevertheless, proper attention to the
two circumstances just mentioned would perhaps, in the generality of cases,
lead at once to the selection of the most favourable site for building upon;
both as regards prospect from the house, and the view towards it; so that as
regards the latter, it would display itself to the utmost advantage. With
respect to the mode of combining buildings with the surrounding scenery, the
following principles and directions are laid down by the ablest of our writers<span class="pagenumindent"><a name="Page_30" id="Page_30">30</a></span>
in the German language, on the subject of landscape gardening.<a name="FNanchor_3" id="FNanchor_3"></a><a href="#Footnote_3" class="fnanchor">[3]</a> "If due
care be taken to distribute the masses of light and shade, so that they shall
judiciously relieve and balance each other, satisfactory effect, as regards the
general grouping and composition of the scenery, can hardly fail to be
secured. Grass, water, and level lawns, which throw no shadow upon other
objects, but merely receive those which the latter cast upon them, are to be
considered as <em>lights</em> in landscape gardening, while trees, woods, buildings,
and rocks, (should there be any) afford the artist his <em>shadows</em> and darker tints.
In making use of these contrary elements, care must be taken lest breadth of
effect be destroyed, and a disagreeable spottiness substituted for it; in consequence
of there being too many separate and partial effects independent of
each other; or else by there being too great a proportion of unbroken <em>light</em>.
On the other hand an equal fault is committed, if a few dark masses of
shadow are allowed so to predominate, as to overpower all besides; or
again, if lawn and water exhibit naked unbroken surfaces of light too harshly
defined; whereas they ought to be left partially to lose themselves in indistinctness,
or the shadow of deep vegetation; or to detach themselves from a
darker background as brilliant lights opposed to it. With respect to buildings,
these ought never to stand perfectly isolated, because in that case they
become spots, and look as if they had no business there, nor belonged to any
of the rest. Besides, a partial concealment is always advantageous to every
kind of beauty, and it is highly desirable that the imagination should be interested
by there being something for it to exercise itself upon, and to divine.
The eye frequently rests with more satisfaction upon a chimney peeping out
in the distance, and emitting a gray volume of smoke from amidst the dense
foliage of trees that embower and exclude from sight the building whose
presence is so indicated, than it does upon a large formal mansion standing
fully exposed to view, with no shelter or skreen on any side, with nothing to
break its outline, with nothing to render it an appropriate and consistent feature
in the general scene." From the beginning of what I have here extracted,
you perceive that this writer treats the subject in a masterly manner, taking
a comprehensive view, and is guided by such sound theoretical principles, as
to be able to determine beforehand, the results of his art with almost as
much certainty as an architect can judge of an intended building from its
ground plan.</p>

</div>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_31" id="Page_31">31</a></span>Having determined upon the precise site, that which seems most recommended
by considerations of healthiness, convenience, &amp;c.; we have next to
attend to what appertains exclusively to architectural treatment and character.
The general idea of the building, as to its chief masses and parts,
extent and arrangement, being sketched out, regard must be had to the greater
or less space of the immediate site; to obtaining for it due effect of light
and shade, and a background calculated to set it off, upon all which circumstances,
it depends nearly as much as a work of sculpture does. In like
manner as statues in general have only three sides from which they are calculated
to be seen, so also have buildings; nor can I help being of opinion
that much harm has been done of late years, both in architecture and sculpture
by the attempt at equal display on all sides. The greater part of antique
statues were evidently intended to have a wall or background behind them;
nor is there, perhaps, any thing more at variance with the effect which
statues ought to produce, than the present frequent practice of erecting them
in the centre of large squares.</p>

<p>Nearly all productions of architecture, more especially structures adapted
for habitation, offer one side stamped as the principal or front, and another,
which is its reverse; in which respect they bear a greater analogy to
living beings than to plants; the latter having no definite foreside, on the contrary,
any part becoming the front, that is towards the spectator. Such being
the case, the same rules that are to be observed for displaying a statue, or
representation of a living figure to advantage, ought to be attended to in
regard to the position of buildings. Agreeing with you that a sheltered situation
is the most desirable for your intended villa, I will attempt to explain it
upon the theory of the following general principles; namely, upon our beholding
any building of the kind, it ought immediately to be evident wherefore
it is so placed, and that by being placed precisely where it is, it is part and
parcel of its immediate vicinity.</p>

<p>But to confine myself to our particular instance. I think I shall be able
to provide an exceedingly agreeable site for your residence, as I learn that a
supply of water may be obtained in the grounds, capable of floating superficies
of about fifty thousand square feet, and depth in proportion. Accordingly
I propose, after the manner shewn in the accompanying ground sketch,
(<a href="#Plate_I">Plate I.</a>) to avail myself of this circumstance, in order to give animation to the
now comparatively tame and lifeless character of the place. The reservoir on
the upper terrace would keep the basin constantly filled to the level of the
lower terrace, before the water escapes into the valley below. By this means, a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_32" id="Page_32">32</a></span>
sheet of water may be provided almost in the centre of the grounds, and my
plan suggests, that the house itself should be erected immediately on the north
shore of this artificial lake. On the spot where I have placed it, the ground
floor would be about fifty feet above the level of the brook itself, and that
part of the grounds through which it runs, consequently would not be exposed
to any injurious exhalations from the lower grounds.</p>

<p>I need hardly point out to you the unusual agreeableness and even piquant
effect of a residence so situated; and when I send my plans for the house
itself, you will see what are the apartments that will occupy this side of the
building, and what a charming prospect they will command of the lake
immediately below, and the grounds on its opposite banks. At present I
will only remark as regards the increased effect thus to be gained, that a
building immediately on the edge of a piece of water appears more considerable
than in any other situation; and that the reflected image of the
architecture will form a brilliant contrast to the darker reflections of trees
and foliage. Besides which, the most favourable point of distance for viewing
the building itself on this side, would thus become fixed&mdash;being that from
the opposite bank of the lake.</p>

<p>A very cursory examination of the plan of the ground will convince you,
that the whole of the buildings you require are massed together in one group.
Such an arrangement certainly contributes to convenience; and I agree with
you by shewing the various offices, instead of attempting to mask or screen
them, the house itself may be made to possess greater importance and apparent
extent; that is, you will get a large looking country house at a small cost.
It may be further remarked, that by adopting such treatment of the plan, some
kind of architectural foreground is introduced into the prospects seen from
the house itself, together with much contrast and variety, and that too without
incurring unnecessary or extra expense, since the same accommodation must
be provided. Another advantage is, that the subordinate buildings of this kind
attached to the main structure, may be made use of as a kind of connecting
link between the more artificial and studied regularity of the latter, and the
natural objects in its immediate vicinity; without which sort of intermediate
transition, a house is apt to have the appearance of a mushroom structure that
has over night started up out of the ground.</p>

<p class="ma-bot2">From the north east angle of the house, the stables extend northwards,
while the conservatories run in an eastern direction from the same point. By
this means an open avenue is left before the north side of the house: and on
the east side a flower garden, which is screened towards the north. The<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_33" id="Page_33">33</a></span>
piece of ground enclosed on two sides by the stables and hothouses or
conservatories, and therefore not exposed to view from the house itself, would
be occupied as the stable-yards, &amp;c. Further on, towards the upper terrace,
is the fruit and kitchen garden, stretching out more eastward. At the end of
the conservatories is the gardener's lodge, the upper part of which forms a
small dovecot.</p>

</div>
</div>


<p class="ma-top2">I have not yet said any thing of the west side of the house, although it
forms one of the principal elevations of the external designs, the carriage
entrance porch being placed there; the approach to which latter is over a
bridge, and by the road which runs to the south-west towards the village.
You therefore perceive that, before they actually arrive, visitors will obtain a
distinct view, across the lake, of the entire range of the buildings from east
to west; from the gardener's lodge and tower along the line of south front
and terrace, to the bridge itself; of which group of architecture, the greater
part, would be reflected in the water, from which it appears immediately to
rise up.</p>

<p>You will observe, I have <em>not</em> carried the approach to the house in a curved
or serpentine direction line, as is generally done, whereby the object to which
the visitor is hastening, is now seen and now again suddenly lost sight of;
but in a <em>straight line</em>, so that the building displays itself more and more
plainly to the eye at every step.</p>

<p>From the high road, the approach is on the north-east; and of the portico
lodge and gate at that entrance into the grounds, the sketch prefixed to this
letter will afford you an idea. The direction of the drives and paths, the
arrangement of the plantations and groups of trees, wherein I have taken care
that the greater part of the fine elms shall remain untouched.</p>

<p>The source of the stream and the weir, from which the superfluous water
finds its way into the lower valley, would almost of course suggest the propriety
of erecting seats at those points of the grounds.</p>

<p>A more detailed description of the house follows by next post, with the
plans and elevations.<a name="FNanchor_4" id="FNanchor_4"></a><a href="#Footnote_4" class="fnanchor">[4]</a></p>

<p class="illudrop p0">AT length I have sent my notions on the site, and
<em>generally</em> as to the house with which I trust
you are satisfied. Now that I come to more
particular description, and to speak of my
design in detail, my confidence is somewhat
abated, it being exceedingly problematical
how far my ideas will accord with your own
wishes and expectations. To the best of my
ability I have endeavoured to meet both; to
fulfil the conditions belonging to the particular
subject and occasion; for be it remarked, every production of art is like every
poem, a composition on some particular occasion or theme; and if it fails of
its purposed aim as such, it may be said to be a failure altogether, and
doomed to oblivion; or rather, in my case, to be stuck up as a monument of
my ignorance. All that I dare hope as yet, is that the drawings have not
been met with a hasty and decided "It won't do;" but that you at least<span class="pagenumindent"><a name="Page_35" id="Page_35">35</a></span>
suspend your judgment until I explain more fully my ideas and the motives
which have guided me.</p>

<p>The principal sitting-rooms face the south, by which means they will have
not only the most favourable aspect, but as it so happens, the best prospect
also; therefore, so far you are not likely to start any objection; neither, I
presume, will any exception be taken at the situation and aspect of the dining-room,
which is towards the east; which last circumstance has induced me
almost, as a matter of course, to place the entrance at the west, or opposite
end of the house, it being on many accounts objectionable; (with regard to
quiet and privacy,) to make the corridor, or inner vestibule running behind
and serving as the communication between the principal apartments immediately
connected with, or in continuation of the first entrance into the house
from the open air; for one reason, because it is hardly possible in such case to
prevent a continual current of cold air through the whole of that part of the
building. Another point here attended to, is to place the dining-room beyond
the other sitting apartments, so that it shall be the last and the most distant
from the entrance. Attention to these circumstances have led to that arrangement
of the space afforded by the plan which I have adopted. In order both
to give some play to that part of the plan, and to avoid all sky-lights, I have
broken the north side of the plan by a small court; surrounded on three sides
by the house, in such manner that from the corridors, &amp;c. turned towards it,
a free prospect of the court and grounds shall present itself from various
points of view; whereby an architectural foreground, and the natural scenery
beyond it are combined; so that you feel yourself in every part of the house
quite in the country.</p>

<p>Permit me now to receive you at the entrance, and be your <em>cicerone</em> over
the building; in which character I must, before we proceed further, call
attention to the exterior of this part, as you will have perceived by the
designs it is carried up loftier than the rest, for the purpose of breaking the
outline, and of providing a conspicuous and important feature in a distant
view of the building. This tower-like portion of the structure does not carry
with it any formidable appearance; it has neither battlements nor watch-turrets,
for which there exist no historical grounds. On the contrary, crowned by
a rich cupola roof, and ornamented with statues, it serves to announce that
the house belongs to a lover of the arts and muses, who may be supposed here
to enjoy at once, the refinements of literature and art, and the beauties of cultivated
nature. The ground floor of this mass of the building is occupied by
the entrance vestibule, which has a vaulted ceiling whose arches descend<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_36" id="Page_36">36</a></span>
rather low, and which is lighted directly, by only a single small window at
some distance from the floor, but which receives a strong reflected light
through the doorways. It is highly desirable that a vestibule, entered immediately
from the open air, should be moderately lighted, in order that the
eyes may not be too much strained at first, but accustom themselves to in-door
light; and also that the other rooms may derive additional effect from the
contrast. Most assuredly too, a subdued degree of light will suffice for a
vestibule which is not intended for a sitting-room, nor for reading, writing, or
any other occupation, consequently, it very properly admits of a kind of Rembrandtish
effect, which here becomes rather a merit than a defect; especially
as it tends to set off all that follows. A group of statues against the wall facing
the entrance, would here produce a good effect on account of the stream of
light which would fall upon it from the window, and would make a pleasing
impression on the visitor as soon as he had crossed the threshold. Instead of
seeing from this vestibule any of the other parts of the house, the situation of
the rooms, or those who may be passing through the corridors, we have first
to turn to the left, where we perceive the staircase, not however exposed to
full view, but merely so as to allow the upper part of it to be seen through a
screen, formed of columns placed upon a lofty stylobate; which I conceive
would produce a more than ordinary picturesque bit of interior architecture.
We do not, however, enter the staircase, but pass on to the hall or inner vestibule,
which affords immediate access to the sitting-rooms. Perhaps I may as
well mention here, that the servants' hall, &amp;c. for the men-servants would be
in the basement at this end of the house, consequently would be just by the
entrance.</p>

<p>The hall or inner vestibule is a spacious room overlooking the small
flower-court above mentioned, the avenue leading to the stables, and the
larger trees on the north side of the house. A small door opens into the
court, while one of rich architectural character forms the entrance to the suite
of rooms occupying the south or water front of the building. This last mentioned
doorway leads into a small ante-room, right and left of which are two
moderate sized drawing-rooms, capable of being used as one when the company
is numerous. The folding doors being thrown open, and the smaller intermediate
room becoming the centre-piece of the triple apartment thus formed. In
front of these three rooms is an open loggia on a somewhat lower level, there
being a descent to it of four steps, looking immediately upon the water; this
loggia would form a sheltered terrace immediately connected with the sitting-rooms
which it would also serve to screen from the sun.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_37" id="Page_37">37</a></span>The library, which, according to your wishes, is made one of the principal
suite of rooms, is the last of those in this front, it being on the south-east
angle. It has an alcove or deeply recessed bay with a window in it, which
not only affords a very agreeable little snuggery, bower, or whatever else you
may term it, for reading or studying, or meditating in apart, but also gives
additional spaciousness and variety to the whole apartment. From this room
a jib or concealed door opens to the small private staircase, and another of the
same kind leads into the flower garden. The larger door on the north side of
the room, is that by which we enter the dining-room, to which, as it is upon
a lower level, there is a descent of a few steps. The reason for this difference
of level is that the room being more spacious requires to be of more height
than the others, and also that it may be upon the same level as the terrace
looking out upon the flower garden.</p>

<p>Beyond the dining-room, is the serving room, and behind that the kitchen,
which, however, does not form part of the body of the house, but is included
in the same range of buildings as the stables, being under the same roof. Attached
to it is a kitchen court, and it is connected with the rest of the house
by the servants' staircase, which last leads both down to the cellars and rooms
in the basement, and to those above for the female domestics, to the childrens'
rooms, &amp;c.</p>

<p>The stables and conservatories call for no other explanation than what the
drawings themselves supply; we will therefore now return to the principal
staircase, on one side of which are two rooms not yet mentioned, one of which
may be used as a business room.</p>

<p>On ascending the stairs, we have first two stranger's rooms on the left, on
the right a billiard-room in the tower, and an upper hall or corridor over
that below, and of the same size though not so lofty; this would serve for the
children to play in and exercise themselves in winter or bad weather. On
the south side of this are two sleeping, and two sitting-rooms, the larger of
which might be used as a winter breakfast-room. The larger of the two
sleeping-rooms, namely, that over the library is the one you would yourself
occupy, it being adjoining the private staircase. On the south side of it is an
alcove, raised a few steps above the rest of the floor; and on the east a small
dressing-room looking out upon the flower garden. The upper part of the
tower contains two other handsome sleeping-rooms, which, as they command
a fine prospect, may be appropriated either to visitors or to the grown up
members of your family.</p>

<p>It has been my endeavour to give an agreeable variety, play and contrast
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_38" id="Page_38">38</a></span>to the different parts of the interior, which I hope will not displease you;
and I trust that the drawings and descriptions of the several apartments, their
architectural character and decoration, which will form the subject of my next
letter, will shew that while I have adhered to one uniform style throughout, I
have neglected neither the variety in the individual parts, nor harmony and
unity of expression in the ensemble, but have reconciled together those two,
somewhat contrary, yet highly desirable qualities.<a name="FNanchor_5" id="FNanchor_5"></a><a href="#Footnote_5" class="fnanchor">[5]</a></p>

My Dear Sir,
</p>

<div  style="width: 132px;">
<img class="drop" src="images/i_012b.jpg" width="132" height="170" alt="Illustrated drop cap letter F" />
</div>

<p class="illudrop p0">FROM the two letters, and the accompanying plans, I
think I fully understand your views. On the whole
I am much pleased with the design, and own your
example has fully supported your precepts; and
bating all pleasure to be derived from associations,
as I have before noticed, I willingly subscribe to
your views, as to the beauty of the principles of
Grecian architecture applied as they have been in
your pleasing design. There are only two points
on which, perhaps, you have allowed your imagination
to carry you too far: first, you have taken rather a poetical notion of
the means to be applied in building, what will, I fear be a very expensive
<span class="pagenumindent"><a name="Page_40" id="Page_40">40</a></span>structure, and larger than was intended; and next as regards the lake, on
the borders of which you propose to place the house. I fully subscribe to
your notions as to the beauty which would be gained by the proposed sheet
of water, and feel all the advantages of the broad expanse of light, and the
extent and variety to be derived from the reflection of the building in this
natural mirror, &amp;c.; but there are disadvantages, some of which are not to be
overcome, and others, of which in my opinion, more than counterbalance all
that is to be gained in beauty and variety.</p>

<p>I suspect you have been misinformed as to the possibility of making the
lake as you propose, and next the expense to execute this perfectly and so as
to ensure that it should always be filled with fresh and transparent water,
would be very considerable, and indeed at times it would be impossible to
accomplish this at any cost. But our climate I think is an insuperable objection
to have a house actually bordering on still water; recollect how few months in
the year the notion of the coolness of water would add pleasure to the prospect
from the library or drawing-room window, and how often one should shudder
at the very notion of it; moreover that according to our apportionment of
the seasons for town and country those very months will be passed in
London,&mdash;April, May, June, and generally July, being the time when "every
body is in town." Although I believe the neighbourhood of water may not
always be unwholesome, still there is much prejudice to overcome on this
subject; not a toothache, cold, or rheumatic twinge would be felt by a
person in the family, from the stable to the drawing-room, but would be
attributed to the <em>pond</em>, for when angry, nobody would call it the <span class="smcap">lake</span>;
malignant malaria would be discussed in every variety of tone and phrase,
and Dr. Chambers would think it his duty to enter his protest against any
patient of his ever venturing to make a visit of twenty-four hours to the proscribed
spot. I am, however, not sorry that you had conceived the notion of
the lake, because it has given an opportunity of shewing what a beautiful
accessory water becomes to a house, applied as you have suggested, and because
I believe you will have no difficulty in substituting some broad expanse
either of turf or gravel, which, though it will not give you the reflections of
the buildings and the play of light you require, will still afford a flat surface
for the receiving the shadows, and will not interrupt the harmony and simplicity
of the general lines of your building. The loggia though it may not
look out upon the water as you propose, will always be delightful as affording
shelter in the winter, and shade in the summer; and the portico is, I think, a
valuable addition. Our unhappy rage for adaptation or rather perversion of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_41" id="Page_41">41</a></span>
the Grecian portico; hitherto the portico has increased rather than diminished,
the distance which has to be traversed in cold and rainy weather,
from the door to the carriage. The perfection of this maladaptation is to be
seen in our unfortunate National Gallery, where is annually erected a tarpaulin
lean-to in order to prevent people being drenched in rainy weather in
their progress to the entrance door, the access to which is opposed by an
inaccessible portico. I quite agree with you that there being no historical
associations connected with the site, it is right that the tower should have
no battlements, and should not show any angry front where no defence
against invading enemies, (whether chartists, socialists, or bread-taxing
tories), is intended. I agree in the advantage to be derived from the
variety of line and the grandeur of the tower, and am willing that the ornaments
you propose of statues should indicate (as it will truly) the propensities
of the owner, especially as terra cotta affords the means at a small
cost, of obtaining examples of fine statues. However, as regards the shape
of the tower, and especially the cupola, some doubts of its beauty have been
expressed, more however by others than myself, though I cannot help feeling
that, if this part partook more of the tall tower of the modern Italian
buildings, finishing with the nearly flat roof and long projecting eaves, the
effect would be more picturesque and less pretending. I mention this merely
for your consideration, and am quite willing that your greater knowledge
and better taste should determine its shape.</p>

<p>As regards the exterior in general, I have little or nothing further to
suggest, except that I may observe that I have remarked in most of the
best modern houses the cornices and ornaments are in my opinion too thin
and minute, and this, I take it, is owing to the too servile copying from
buildings designed for a country where the sun shines nearly throughout the
year, and where the light colour of the material (unstained by damp or
weather) marks more sharply and completely the light and shade than is
the case in our gloomy season, and where the walls are soon disfigured and
weather-stained. Although I assume that the project of the lake is to be
abandoned, yet I should wish still that the ground floor should be at least
raised as much above the level as it at present is. Although every facility of
access to the gardens and grounds is desirable in a country house, yet I think
it is disagreeable to be on an actual level with the walks; both from the interior
and from the exterior, it gives the notion of the house springing from the
earth as a mushroom, as you have observed. I will now follow you through the
building at your invitation, observing that I agree as to the choice of aspects<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_42" id="Page_42">42</a></span>
and the arrangements of the rooms. With reference to this, the west is well
arranged so as to avoid that aspect for any of the rooms to be generally inhabited,
and I subscribe to the notion that the entrance should be somewhat gloomy,
at least enough so, as to create a feeling of pleasure on emerging into more
light. As regards the large hall, perhaps for the size and style of the house
there is a little too much sacrificed to it; but as I think it is an object of importance
to obtain an open and airy access to the whole suit of rooms, and as
this will afford ample scope for ornament, and casts of statues and bas-reliefs,
and perhaps fresco ornamental painting, I am willing that some sacrifice
should be made. The two rooms beyond the staircase will be useful, and
indeed are necessary. I have already appropriated one as a gun room and
audience chamber for those whose shoes may not be clean enough to be
admitted to the best library.</p>

<p>I like the disposition of the two drawing-rooms; perhaps, however, it may
be worth consideration whether it may not be better to make some sacrifice
of symmetry, and convert them into two rooms, one large and one small;
keeping the small one at the end next the staircase, and making it either
octagon or circular; either shape is pleasing, and admits of variety in decoration.
In that case it would be advisable to make separate entrances to
each room for the interior hall: indeed, if the present arrangement is retained,
this may be desirable, so as to avoid using the middle room entirely as a
passage room. As regards the library, I have no observation to make on its
shape or disposition. I assume that the two windows will sufficiently light it.
At first I thought that it might be advisable to have the means of shutting off
the recess by sliding doors from the large room, making a kind of inner library
or study of it; but I presume, as this would leave but one window, the large
room would be too dark. I think it would be desirable that there should be
an entrance to the dining-room across the hall and through the corridor, as
well as through the library. There might be occasions where it may be
inconvenient to pass through the library to the dining-room, although this
might be considered as the usual and grand entrance. I do not see where
you have placed your fire-place in the library. I should conceive from its
size, that you might want either two fire-places, or at least one stove and one
fireplace to warm so large a room. The mention of fireplaces reminds me that
I see no chimneys in the drawing, I suppose they are hidden by the balustrade.
I shall be glad if this is so, as it will be well to get rid of so unsightly
an object as chimneys generally are.</p>

<p>As regards the kitchen, it certainly is well placed with reference to the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_43" id="Page_43">43</a></span>
convenience of access to the dining-room; but though not under the same roof
with the house, I should fear that not only the smell of the cooking, but the
noise of the offices may reach the dining-room. This is a common evil, and
one which it is essential to avoid. When we come to discuss the offices more
in detail, this point must be well considered. I approve of the dining-room
windows opening on the flower-garden, as this will also (unless when we are
alone) be the breakfast room, and occasionally the morning room in hot
weather; perhaps, however, to avoid any notion of coldness, only <em>one</em> of the
three windows should go down to the floor and open on the garden.</p>

<p>As regards the kitchen, there must be added some additional offices, such
as scullery, out-door's larder, &amp;c. &amp;c. but as I see space sufficient for these
in the direction of the orangery, this will make no material alteration in your
plan. In addition to the wine and beer cellars, I think the servants' offices
may be well included in the space under the east and south fronts, particularly
as I think it will be necessary that some sleeping rooms for servants should
be obtained in the attics, and I presume your plan will admit of this without
deranging your elevation; though I am aware something must be sacrificed in
the height of the rooms; but though there may, for the purpose of protection
of the lower part of the house, be a sleeping room for one or two men-servants,
yet I think the women's sleeping apartments will not be conveniently arranged
on the basement story. As it is important to economize, I should suggest to
you that it will not be necessary to continue the basement story on the west
front, and perhaps not under the interior or large hall. As regards the
arrangement of the sleeping-rooms, if the attics are obtained, I think those
you propose sufficient. If any more should be required, perhaps the large
corridor or hall might be abridged, and at all events the billiard room may
be made into another bed-room, and the billiard table taken down to the hall:
increasing moral habits and the spread of useful knowledge, prevents our
employing so much time as formerly in mere games of amusement, and I
observe that the billiard room is somewhat going out of fashion, and that
where it remains, is rarely used. I should, however, be sorry to give it up
altogether. It is a very useful and innocent assistant with a dull party on a
rainy day, or during a long evening at Christmas; and occasionally is a good
"bore escape." The dressing-room at the east angle is inaccessible except
through the bedroom, but this is an evil which cannot be in all cases avoided.</p>

<p>I have thus given you in detail the observations which occur to me on
going over your plan, and except such alterations as occur to you as necessarily
arising out of the rejection of the lake, I would not wish that any alteration<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_44" id="Page_44">44</a></span>
should be made, and I shall be glad to receive from you the details as
to the interior, and your opinion as to the few alterations I have suggested.</p>

<p>You have not stated to what use you design to put the building at the top of
the north-east end; this, I presume, is to remain open, and so merely designed
as a balance for the tower. Perhaps, however, it may be put to some use, either
as a store or lumber room: I think it adds much to the picturesque appearance
of the whole. Although I have rejected the lake, I should be sorry to lose
the bridge in the approach, but as the ground in front slopes, a terrace may
be well substituted, and perhaps the bridge may remain as passing over some
road, or may form some part of the arrangement as to the angles of the
terrace.</p>

<p>As regards your observations of the position of the house, I agree with
what you state, but when I consult you in detail on the order and disposition
of the grounds, I propose to make some suggestions on the subject. With
respect to the materials, I assume you mean to have light coloured brick with
stone at the angles, and for the moulding. I presume the additions of painting
and sculpture (one of the grounds for the rejection of the Gothic) will play
their proper part in the interior; as in the exterior, except in respect of the
figures in the tower, no addition is gained from them in the elevation.</p>

<div style="width: 167px;">
<img class="drop" src="images/i_018b.png" width="167" height="170" alt="Illustrated drop cap letter T" />
</div>

<p class="illudrop p0">Thanks for your letter approving of my design
in the principal parts of the interior; I shall
now briefly point out the materials which I
would recommend to be employed for the
floors, walls, and ceilings.</p>

<p>For the entrance hall, I propose that the
doorcases, chimney-piece, and the socle or
dado should be carried up about four feet
high, and should be of yellowish Derbyshire
marble, and the walls in stucco, but made to
show the joints of different courses, and marbled in fresco of a lighter tint than
the rest, while the vaulted ceiling should have the ribs coloured white and
brown upon a pale blue ground; for here in the lower part of the tower it<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_46" id="Page_46">46</a></span>
will, I conceive, be most proper to indicate as forcibly as possible to the eye,
solidity of material and construction.</p>

<p>In the second or inner hall, which we enter from the preceding one, and
beyond which is obtained a view of the staircase, as seen through the columns
placed on a stylobate, serving as a screen to the stairs, the walls might be
marbled of a light greenish tint, intermixed in the socle with brown lines.
The columns and entablature should be white; and the ceiling panelled in
wainscot, with coffers or compartments containing ornaments in relief on a
green ground. As regards this part of the interior, I would remark that
should such be deemed preferable, there would be no objection to filling in
the upper part of the screen (that is, the openings between the columns) with
glass. While this would prevent all draught from the staircase, and in some
degree intercept sound also, it would not in anywise affect the general design;
but rather might be made to conduce to it, by adopting some ornamental
pattern, of course in a corresponding style. Both in this and the preceding
vestibule, the floor should be paved with marble or coloured stone, as should
also that of the corridors; but the large hall should have a parquetted wood
flooring, because that room will occasionally be made use of for dancing. In
this last, the walls should be wainscoted and panelled with oak, to the height
of about seven feet; and the doorway which forms the entrance to the suite
of sitting-rooms should be distinguished by richness of carved decoration in
the same material. I further recommend the application of embellishment of
inlaid woods or marquetrie of different colours, for the cornice or upper
mouldings of this wainscoting, so as to produce a rich border or band along
the walls, above which there will remain space for pictures in frames, (inclining
forwards) and even if these paintings are of no very great value in themselves
as works of art, they will be of use as contributing to the general design, and
add greatly to its effect. The upper part of the walls might be painted in
fresco in imitation of grey marble streaked with red, which last mentioned
colour should be that of the coffers in the wainscoted ceiling.</p>

<p>The ante-room or first room of the suite being smaller than the others,
should have a coved ceiling, in order to diminish its apparent height; and
this might be painted with Arabesque ornaments on a white ground, somewhat
after the manner of several of the ceilings of Julio Romano in the Villa <em>Lanti</em>.
The walls of this and of the two adjoining rooms should be hung with silk or
other stuff of a quiet sober hue, so as to give the greatest relief to the pictures,
I taking it for granted that you would be inclined to place here the principal
part of such pictures as you may possess.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_47" id="Page_47">47</a></span>Though the ceilings of the two drawing-rooms should not be much ornamented,
yet they may be relieved by the introduction of gilding in parts.
For all these rooms I propose that the doors, &amp;c. should be white with gilt
mouldings. In the library, the ribs or bands of the vaulted ceiling should be
gilt upon a white ground; and as regards the bookcases or shelves for books,
they ought to be of some light coloured wood, highly polished, and not go
higher than the corbels or consoles from which the vaulting springs, in order
that there may be sufficient space for busts, vases, and other ornaments of that
kind upon the cornices; and this will avoid the inconvenience of having the
upper shelves quite out of reach, except with the help of high library steps&mdash;always
inconvenient. For the lunettes or arched spaces between the corbels,
I have not proposed any particular decoration, as they might be filled up by
reliefs and casts let into the wall.</p>

<p>The dining room with the arcs-doubleaux and compartments of its vaulted
ceiling afford scope for fresco painting of a superior style; and the pencil of
our friend Eastlake, who has already shown so much classical talent in decorating
the dining-room in London, might render this one of the most striking
and charming apartments of its kind in England. It is true that fresco is so
little practised in your country, and consequently its process so imperfectly
understood, that he would probably have to encounter some difficulties at the
outset; but I flatter myself I could be of considerable assistance to him, as
regards the practical details, having already succeeded in introducing that
mode of painting in spite of most unfavourable circumstances. I would advise
that the pictures should be confined to the ceiling and the lunettes, and that
the walls should be merely stuccoed, as being upon the whole more in accordance
with the destination of the room itself, and affording a quieter background
to the company seated around the dinner-table; at the same time that
the frescoes in the upper part of the room would thereby show to greater
advantage. You will observe that the fresco requires a bold broad style, and
has an advantage over oil, as it is very effective even when not seen by a
strong or favourable light. Should somewhat more of decoration be thought
advisable, I would suggest the adoption of glass-mosaic in narrow upright
pannels at intervals. Of this species of embellishment, which was much used
by the Romans, and after, much in vogue throughout Italy during the middle
ages, for pulpits, monuments, &amp;c. I have lately introduced an application
in a room fitted up by myself, the effect of which is allowed to be singularly
striking and good.</p>

<p>The remaining drawing shows the large corridor on the upper floor.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_48" id="Page_48">48</a></span>I need hardly remark that these designs are only intended to convey an
idea of the general character and style of the different rooms, as submitted to
you for consideration. Much yet remains to be definitively settled, there
being a variety of circumstances with which I am at present but imperfectly
acquainted; nor can I possibly say what modifications of the plan I should
advise, until I know wherein you consider it objectionable, or wherein it fails to
meet your precise wishes. Some objections I may probably be able to combat;
others may possibly, by leading me to consider the points in difference afresh,
enable me to hit upon variations that may not immediately occur to me.
Much will depend upon your collection of works of art, which is as yet but
imperfectly known to me; much also upon my meeting with clever workmen,
capable, not only of entering into my ideas, and executing without further
trouble any piece of decoration that may be required, but also, as has not
seldom happened to me, of suggesting valuable hints during the progress of
the work. So far indeed am I from wishing you to decide at once in favour
of what I propose, I am most of all solicitous that you should as completely
comprehend not only the general scheme, but the contemplated effect of every
part. Undoubtedly it is very pleasant to an architect to meet with an
employer disposed to give him <em>carte-blanche</em> and permission to follow out his
own ideas unrestrictedly; yet it is still more delightful to meet with one who,
instead of merely passively acquiescing, assents from conviction after deliberate
study of the ideas submitted to him, and from the lively interest he
takes in them.</p>

<p>If I have ventured to propose marble, gilding, fresco painting, and glass-mosaic,
do not be alarmed at the seeming extravagance, or imagine that any
great expense will be incurred. In architecture the most durable materials
are the most economical, and they carry with them a nobleness of appearance
not attainable by even lavish ornaments, costly at first, yet of a perishable
nature. Consider what large sums are expended in the course of a few years
in keeping up houses that have to be repaired or refitted up from time to time
as regards all but their bare walls, in consequence either of the materials
getting soiled and shabby, or of the changes of fashion, which having been
the only guidance in matters of taste at first, must continue to be consulted
and conformed to, otherwise the whole looks out of date; whereas, that which
is originally beautiful, independently of any particular fashion of the day,
will so remain, let the caprice of fashion change as it will. I do really
believe there are many rooms that would have cost their owners less, had
they been entirely lined with marble, and otherwise ornamented with fresco<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_49" id="Page_49">49</a></span>
painting and mosaic, than they have done in consequence of being furbished
up every now and then by decorators and paper-hangers, and often in very
questionable taste, while after all, the effect for the time is at the best of an
inferior kind.</p>

<p>Besides by economy and a little dexterity of management even materials
may be obtained at a comparatively moderate cost: works in <em>Carrara</em> marble,
for instance, may be executed in Italy from designs sent over for that purpose,
at about half the price, including freight and duty, which they would cost
in England. The only inconvenience is that they cannot be furnished so
promptly, it being requisite that the orders for them should be given some
time beforehand. You will perhaps recollect the circumstance I have stated
in respect to this matter in my "<span class="smcap">Architectura Domestica</span>."</p>

<p>As to gilding&mdash;oil-gilding is cheaper than water-gilding; which last has
only the advantage of looking more brilliant than the former at first. Fresco
painting, again is less expensive than any mode of painting in oil; for it
necessarily demands far greater rapidity of execution, and the effect being
produced at once, instead of the work proceeding through all the different
stages from dead colouring to the last finishing. How very poor a succedaneum
for fresco painting is Gobelius tapestry! in which latter the execution
is entirely mechanical, giving a mere soulless plodding transcript of the
original, while as some of the colours fade sooner than the rest, the whole
becomes in a short time quite inharmonious. I am moreover convinced that
there are many able artists now living, who would execute designs in fresco
for the same price that is paid for designs in tapestry; so that durability
being considered, the saving accruing from the former would be considerable.
Nor is it the least important consideration of all, that art itself would be
extensively benefited by the adoption of such practice. I at least am
thoroughly convinced, that a single room painted in fresco by an able artist
would do more for the advancement of sound art in England than a score of
commissions for oil-pictures, or than a hundred so called illustrated editions
of popular works, with wood cuts. Pre-eminently gifted as is England with
a true feeling for colouring, there is no doubt but that her school would be
able to impart a fresh vigour to fresco painting, and would set a bright
example to the continent in this branch of the art.</p>

<p class="center minus-indent">TO CHARLES LOCK EASTLAKE, ESQ. R.A. <span class="smcap">Etc.</span></p>



<p class="smcap">My Dear Sir,
</p>


<p class="illudrop-print p0">AT length I write to claim the performance of your
promise, viz. that you would give me your advice as
regards the decoration of the house designed by M.
de Chateauneuf, the drawings and plans for which
you have seen. After some discussion, and a struggle
on my part in favour of the Elizabethan, the Perpendicular-gothic,
or whatever the style is to be
designated, M. de Chateauneuf has triumphed, and
the Italian, or revived antique, (essentially the Grecian,)
has been finally agreed on.</p>

<p>You are aware how strongly I feel that one of the best modes of advancing
the fine arts, is by paying greater attention to the interior decorations
of our houses, than has hitherto been the fashion in England. The best
proof of your own opinion on this subject, is the kindness with which you<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_51" id="Page_51">51</a></span>
devoted much time and labour to the designing and executing for me the
Pompeian room so deservedly admired. Entertaining this view on the subject
of ornament, makes me the more anxious to take all possible pains in
selecting the style of decoration, so as the house should prove that its
owner is a lover of art, and that it should, as far as is compatible with a
reasonable economy, be considered in some degree as a pattern of what
might be accomplished in the matter of decoration. I never think on the
subject without calling to mind the principles laid down for the ornamenting
a country house, in Mr. Rogers's "Invitation to a Friend:" indeed, looking
to his intimate knowledge of the whole circle of fine arts, and lastly, the
specimen of refined taste which his own town house exhibits, my <em>beau
ideal</em> is a house decorated under his direction; but as this cannot be
obtained, I trust that you, who possess so much of his spirit and refinement,
will, as far as may be compatible with your engagements, afford me the benefit
of your assistance. Although the subject of decoration, both as regards
houses and public buildings, has been hitherto much neglected in this
country, I think now every one is becoming fully alive to its importance.
The establishment of the Government School of Design, in which, for
the first time in England, the art of design, as applied to decoration, is
systematically taught;&mdash;the opportunity afforded by the building of the
Houses of Parliament;&mdash;the Committee of the House of Commons, which
has already reported on the subject of their decoration;&mdash;and the Royal
commission entrusted with the further consideration of the subject,&mdash;cannot
fail to produce within a few years a great alteration in the views and taste of
the public. I may here observe, that the School of Design, and the training
of young workmen, will mainly tend to assist those who may be inclined
to give up the ornamenting their saloons and halls with cheap printed papers,
by producing persons who will be able, at a moderate cost, to execute the
original designs of eminent artists, or to copy the great works of antiquity.
Hitherto, except when foreigners were introduced, it has been scarcely possible
to obtain the assistance of workmen capable of executing anything beyond
the commonest and simplest scrolls or straight lines; or if such assistance
were obtained, it could only be procured at a cost which put any extensive
scale of decoration beyond the reach of any but the affluent.</p></div>

<p>As regards the style and mode of execution of the proposed decorations,
I should, of course, wish to be guided by your judgment. Whether it may
be expedient merely to copy or adapt from known examples, such as the
baths of Titus, and the paintings of Pompeii, or from the great masters of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_52" id="Page_52">52</a></span>
modern times, such as the designs of Raphael and Giulio Romano;&mdash;or
whether an entirely new style, founded on a study of the general principles
of art as applied to decoration, should be attempted, is for you to determine.
Again, it may be a question, whether in different rooms a different course
should be pursued, for the sake of variety. Respecting the vehicle, whether
encaustic, fresco, or oil, or all three, should be used, must be determined
by you.</p>

<p>You will observe there is the outer hall, and staircase, the inner hall,
the library, the two drawing rooms, and the dining room, all requiring your
attention.</p>

<p>The library, I should wish to be devoted as far as possible to art,
especially as the books it will contain relate principally to painting and sculpture.</p>

<p class="rma5 ma-top2">
I remain yours very sincerely,</p>

<p class="rma">
H. B.
</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p class="ma-bot4">P. S.&mdash;I should state that this application is made to you, with the perfect
assent, nay, indeed, at the request of M. de Chateauneuf, who is desirous that
his design should have the benefit of your advice, as regards its ornament:
the specimen given in M. de Chateauneuf's work on Domestic Architecture,
of the embellishment of the house executed by him at Hamburgh, and
indeed some observations he has sent to me, sufficiently prove that he is in
nowise deficient in this important branch of an architect's duty.</p>

<p class="smcap">My Dear Sir,
</p>

<p class="cap p0">I SHOULD willingly refer you to abler advisers if M.
de Chateauneuf's house were as real as it deserves
to be; but although the conditions which you and the
architect have proposed to yourselves have led to very
definite arrangements in the structure itself, a pleasing
uncertainty may be assumed to exist with regard to the
decorations: in a word, I can scarcely shrink from a
responsibility as ideal as the subject of our speculation.</p>

<p>I am sorry you have again referred to a certain "Pompeian"
room; believe me, too much has been said of
what you know was a rough experiment, to see the effect
of a particular kind of decoration for small rooms, and
which, as regards its details, can only deserve attention
from the skill with which Mr. Harvey executed the
animals that are introduced.</p>

<p>The word "decoration," however appropriate to fantastic
ornaments, and in some degree to insulated figures,
has, as you know, been considered vilifying when applied
to works that are addressed to the mind. But, as
we have no other term, we must consent to use it in both
meanings. It is, indeed, important to remember, that no
works of art, however elevated, can dispense with the
appeal, the impressive or winning appeal, to the eye.
Thus much for our definition of terms.</p>

<p>As a general principle in decoration, I would recommend
that the eye should be solely or chiefly addressed<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_54" id="Page_54">54</a></span>
where a passing glance only can be given to the work, and that the attention
should be more taxed where leisure and surrounding circumstances permit
or invite contemplation. The reverse of this would be manifestly wrong;
but the recommendation itself is not to be understood too literally. Every
display has its legitimate exuberance: the "over and above" in decoration
can only be that of quality, for mere taste is supposed to define all that
relates to quantity. As common poetic description sometimes exalts its subject
less by accumulation than by supposing costly materials where mean
ones would do, so in art the augmenting excellence ascends from sense to
thought. If, therefore, the intention to afford mental pleasure is very apparent
even in situations where this may appear superfluous and in a manner
thrown away, the impression must of itself be elevating. But the indispensable
condition is, that a gradation should still be maintained; that higher
excellence should still be in reserve. What must be the character of works
of art to which Raphael's Corridor in the Vatican forms the mere approach?
The answer is given by the perfection of the works in the Stanze. All that
is to be insisted on, therefore, is a due gradation in conformity with the
principle first proposed. In the remarks that follow, I cannot strictly follow
the plan of the house, but must often generalize; the observations submitted,
if tenable at all, will, however, be easily applicable to your purpose.</p>

<p>The pavement of the halls might be enriched, but I can hardly approve
the occasional practice of the ancients in placing mosaic "histories" under
their feet:<a name="FNanchor_6" id="FNanchor_6"></a><a href="#Footnote_6" class="fnanchor">[6]</a> the objections are sufficiently obvious. The forms and hues
employed should be merely calculated to gratify the sight. Among other
preliminary considerations, I would also include the nature of the mere
surface, as well as the distinction of every apartment. Thus a pavement,
however decorated, should still express the character of firmness and solidity.
For this reason I would banish even the lowest kind of life, (that of plants,)
and every approach to perspective. Geometrical forms would thus be alone
admissible: the variety is infinite; but even here I would again exclude
abrupt and irregular contrasts of colour, which have sometimes the effect of
making the evenness of the surface doubtful: the last consideration is even
applicable to carpets. With respect to the classic fashion of inscriptions on<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_55" id="Page_55">55</a></span>
the threshold,<a name="FNanchor_7" id="FNanchor_7"></a><a href="#Footnote_7" class="fnanchor">[7]</a> I merely remark, that letters are only ornamental in architecture
when disposed symmetrically, and enclosed in a regular frame-work.</p>

<div class="footnote">
<p class="footnote"><a name="Footnote_6" id="Footnote_6"></a><a href="#FNanchor_6"><span class="label">[6]</span></a> The passion for this kind of decoration was carried so far that the ornamented floor of
the dining-room sometimes represented the scattered fragments of a repast. <em>Plin.</em> I. xxxvi.
c. 25.</p>

<p class="footnote"><a name="Footnote_7" id="Footnote_7"></a><a href="#FNanchor_7"><span class="label">[7]</span></a> Even the Mosaic floor at the entrance to bed-rooms, had inscriptions; a pavement of this
kind was found at Brindisi, with the words <span class="smcap">bene dormio</span>.</p>
</div>

<p>In approving the common practice of placing statues and bas-reliefs in
the principal hall, I do not depart from the spirit of our first principles. A
statue has generally the advantage of being seen in various points of view,
and thus commands attention in situations where paintings could not. The
rich effect of bas-reliefs is sufficient to recommend them; associations of
classic taste are naturally connected with the classic materials of marble or
bronze; and architecture, when displayed as such, seems to acquire additional
solidity by the presence of sculpture. But works of sculpture of the first
excellence should be admitted to the library or drawing room, and even fragments
of rare beauty should be enshrined with like distinction. For the
present, however, we are in the hall. I do not recommend mixing mural
painting and sculpture: no painted devices should compete injudiciously
with the bas-reliefs. But let us suppose that your bas-reliefs are in the
outer hall, and that you have only some sculptured vases on detached
pedestals in the inner hall or corridor, then by all means decorate the walls
of the latter with arabesques: to these we shall return. In the staircase,
also, it will be necessary to make your election between the two arts. I
will assume that you decide for painting. Few people linger in a staircase;
still fewer break their necks to look at a painted ceiling. If the scene
affects the eye and the imagination agreeably, this may be considered sufficient.
When we see the whole Pantheon on the ceiling and walls of
great staircases, this undoubtedly might be defended on the ground that
a mere passing impression of magnificence is intended: but the exuberance
of quantity rather than of quality is here obvious. In whatever mode the
walls of the staircase are adorned, the decoration should be entirely subservient
to the architectural effect. This involves a more radical objection to
the mythologic crowds before alluded to, because they have frequently the
effect (and intentionally so) of destroying all idea of the angles of the
building. I am of opinion, on the contrary, that the decorator should dispose
his paintings in shapes which shall appear to grow out of and complete
the architecture. The inclination of the panelling of the wall to agree
with the line of the stairs, may be considered incompatible with paintings:
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_56" id="Page_56">56</a></span>
a horizontal termination, perhaps level with the chief landing-place, is
essential, and the triangular spaces, or sections of such spaces, between this
and the stairs, had better be left nearly plain, and not very light in colour.
Of all mistakes, that of introducing painted figures, sometimes the size of life,
where living figures must so often come in contact with them, is the worst.</p>

<p>The compartment or compartments above the horizontal line might be
painted in fresco, certainly not in oil on the wall, nor in the newly revived
encaustic, at least not till it has been further tried. The figures should
not extend to the angles of the walls where the staircase turns; the pseudo
or real compartments which form the frames might finish at a little distance
from the angle; the real wall is, in short, never to be lost sight of;
and whatever merits ocular illusion may have in paintings generally, it
would be injudicious to attempt it here. Where the light is unfavourable
for painting, the flattest style of bas-relief is still admissible. But as
you are especially desirous of having your staircase coloured, I really can
propose nothing fitter to gratify the eye and imagination merely, than the
more refined and at the same time familiar subjects of the Greek mythology;
such as the personifications of Poetry, the progress of the Hours
and of Light, and so forth. Such subjects afford the best materials for
mere beauty of line and drapery, for composition generally, and, if not too
statue-like, for colour; and even when they suggest no profounder range of
thought, (not that their import is necessarily thus superficial,) they leave an
elegant impression on the mind. The objection is, that they are old; but
there would be some novelty in treating them as detached compositions,
instead of beclouding and peopling the whole space in the style of the
seventeenth century. It is to be remarked, that Raphael and Michael Angelo
bounded their compositions of this kind by definite forms, especially on
ceilings. Pietro da Cortona and the machinists generally, were as intent
on destroying the connection between painting and architecture as the great
masters were to preserve it.</p>

<p>But this separation of the compositions into compartments supposes at
once a great latitude in the choice of subjects. Milton's smaller poems, and
many other English sources, might be preferred to classic inventions; only it
should be remembered, that fresco, from the nature of its means, is privileged
to aim at the ideal rather than the actual world, and that the character of the
decorations required for the place must necessarily influence the selection
and treatment of the subjects. Dark effects are equally unfit for the situation<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_57" id="Page_57">57</a></span>
and for the powers of fresco. In the ornamented divisions of the compartments,
perhaps partial gilding might be employed with better effect than
colours; on the ceiling both might be introduced, (in merely decorative
forms,) unless your staircase ends in light, in which case your glass must of
course be ornamented, even if colourless.</p>

<p>Dining rooms, strictly so called and employed, are generally unadorned
with pictures: this hardly seems necessary. In theory we may admit that
subjects requiring some contemplation would be out of place in a room
exclusively devoted to "the table;" but portraits of celebrated individuals,
and landscapes, although they cannot be duly examined in such moments,
may convey associations, to which the spectator, even if not particularly
conversant in pictures, is supposed to be alive at all times. Portraits of the
class alluded to, as historic texts, are connected with <em>time</em>; and landscape,
especially if founded on actual scenes, suggests the conditions of <em>place</em>. A
room used for the purpose in question, and for <em>nothing else</em>, is, however, not
the place where fine works of art should be bestowed; and I incline to think
that this is the fittest field for small frescos and arabesques. This, in short,
is one of the occasions to please the eye and the imagination merely.
Accordingly, in the mode proposed, no definite idea is presented to the mind,
but an air of elegant and festive splendour surrounds the guests. There
should, however, be endless variety; scarcely a form should be repeated in
the details, although an architectural symmetry is, as usual, to be preserved in
the masses.</p>

<p>A dining room <em>per se</em> is not uncommon; but a professed and exclusive
breakfast room supposes a degree of order in the family migrations, to
which the muses could hardly be expected to accommodate themselves.
Nevertheless, to complete my catalogue, I will suppose one; or rather I will
suppose that one of your drawing rooms is used chiefly as a morning room.
Indeed, without condemning a family to betake themselves to particular
rooms at stated hours, it may be allowable to decorate and furnish apartments
on such a supposition, by way of ensuring a marked and agreeable
variety of character. Lucullus had even a series of dining rooms from the
"Apollo" downwards; and we learn from Vitruvius,<a name="FNanchor_8" id="FNanchor_8"></a><a href="#Footnote_8" class="fnanchor">[8]</a> that the opulent
Romans changed the scene of their banquets according to the season of the
year. The morning has its own feelings even for those whom affluence frees<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_58" id="Page_58">58</a></span>
from any kind of labour. The purposes of the day are unfinished&mdash;every thing
is contingent. Under such circumstances the character or subject of pictures
is to be adapted to the mind&mdash;not the mind to the subject. The open face
of nature by sea and land may here enliven the walls, and agree with the
excursive feelings of the hour. The chase and its incidents may here
triumph. The English pastoral is here strictly in its place. Solemn themes,
solemn effects, should not be admitted; while all that responds to buoyancy
of spirit would, on the contrary, be appropriate. It need not be gravely
objected, that accidental or even average states of feeling may be little in
unison with the impressions which the arts profess to give; for the same
objection is frequently applicable to all of the accompaniments of civilized life,
nay, to the beauties of nature, which so often appeal even to cultivated
human sympathies in vain. The occasional contradiction is unavoidable,
where, of two conditions, one is permanent, the other mutable.</p>

</div>

<p>Corridors on the ground-floor, or even upstairs in houses where pictures
do not abound, may be fitly decorated with arabesques. The same kind of
ornament might be applied to garden pavilions, and, in the present instance,
even to your portico next the lake, if there are no statues there, but not to
conservatories, where the conventional forms and tints of art would contend
injudiciously with nature. In these decorations it is absolutely necessary
to set out with an architectural scheme, and subdivide the spaces with some
attention to congruity and subordination. In the details, pleasing masses and
forms are essential, because here nothing can be concealed; there is, strictly
speaking, no chiaro-scuro, no perspective: form and colour are the chief
means. The possibility of approaching and even coming in contact with
the painted wall, suggests the necessity of a small scale in the objects, and
of precision and delicacy of outline; yet, from the circumstance of the forms
and hues being relieved on a light ground, they are at the same time effective
at a considerable distance.<a name="FNanchor_9" id="FNanchor_9"></a><a href="#Footnote_9" class="fnanchor">[9]</a> Stucco ornaments in very low relief, mixed
with the painting, are admissible, (as they can hardly be said to come under
the head of sculpture,) but they require a strong light to display them.</p>

<div class="footnote">
<p class="footnote"><a name="Footnote_9" id="Footnote_9"></a><a href="#FNanchor_9"><span class="label">[9]</span></a> The best examples of decorations of this kind are now accessible to all, in a recently
published work by Thurmer and Gutensohn, containing the arabesques of the Vatican, the
Farnesina, the Villa Lanti, and the Villa Madama: edited by Ludwig Gruner, to be had of
Mr. Murray, Albemarle Street: with this work may be classed the publications of Zahn, on
the ornamental inventions of Giulio Romano at Mantua, and on the decorations of Pompeii.</p>
</div>

<p>I cannot recommend frescos for the sitting rooms of dwelling houses.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_59" id="Page_59">59</a></span>
The sum of enjoyment to be derived from one or two large paintings is not
to be compared to that which the contributions of various schools can afford,
even assuming the highest merit. It is true, frescos like those of the Villa
Madama near Rome, from the school of Raphael, may be beautifully
executed in a small size, but they still seem fitter for open galleries than for
rooms. (I have only ventured to except the dining room.) The impossibility
of change in such situations is an unpleasant feeling; in a public building,
on the contrary, it is satisfactory, and a staircase approaches this character. I
may here observe, that a staircase covered with ancient family portraits is
seldom agreeable to the eye; indeed if it were a desirable kind of decoration,
centuries must often elapse before the materials would be ready. The first
impression on seeing a quantity of portraits in a staircase is, that it is an
accidental if not a troublesome accumulation, and that there is no room for
the pictures in better situations. Far be it from me to speak with any disrespect
of the taste for family portraits so peculiar to the English. The
domestic "charities," it has been often observed, are pleasingly fostered by
them; but I hold it not always necessary to place the portraits of the household
in prominent situations. The interest such works inspire is in most
cases strictly domestic and private. The portrait has, in short, no pretension
to be conspicuous to all eyes till the individual is celebrated, or till the work
of art is canonized. These conditions, I admit, may often exist from the
first; but then, <em>à fortiori</em>, a staircase is not the place for such a production.
The Romans appropriated one of the most public rooms of the house (the
<em>tablinum</em>) to genealogies, records, and inscriptions relating to the family
history, and covered the remaining space&mdash;often the <em>atrium</em> as well&mdash;with
the portraits and busts of their ancestors.<a name="FNanchor_10" id="FNanchor_10"></a><a href="#Footnote_10" class="fnanchor">[10]</a> This does not appear to have
been the custom with the Athenians.</p>

</div>

<p>We have decided against frescos in what are called sitting rooms: your
oil pictures are, however, to be selected. I shall consider the library as distinct
from the drawing rooms; but it is quite possible to blend their character.
The library in the ducal palace at Urbino, had a room or study adjoining it,
decorated with portraits (in this case, by the way, they appear to have been
frescos) of learned men of all ages. In a library, literally to be used as such,
pictures of extensive interest seem to be inappropriate. They may be said to
divert the attention from the business or amusement of the place. But the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_60" id="Page_60">60</a></span>
portrait of the poet, or the sage, is a source of pleasing and elevating associations,
and may sometimes command a deep interest. The library may contain
the cabinets of gems and medals, the collections of engravings, the terra
cottas, &amp;c.; or if the drawing room is ample enough, all these treasures of
virtù may be deposited there. I prefer a library without coloured decorations;
the wood-work may be carved in flat relief, even to the panels of the
walls; a mode of decoration now beautifully supplied by embossed leather,
which need not be dark in colour. Whatever colour appears, except in the
portraits, miniatures, or illuminations hung around, should be in the books;
these should strike the eye, and be, so to speak, in the foreground of the
picture. Vases, or busts, may surmount the cases. The ancients preferred
the latter; and many, like Asinius Pollio, collected in their libraries the
authentic, and even imaginary, portraits of great men. Among the latter
was the bust of Homer.<a name="FNanchor_11" id="FNanchor_11"></a><a href="#Footnote_11" class="fnanchor">[11]</a> The light is generally so unfavourable in the
upper part of modern rooms, that busts when placed so high, are reduced
to mere ornaments, and require the addition of names. This, indeed, is not
objectionable in any case, for the interest of a portrait commonly depends on
historical associations. I see no objection even to inscribing both the subject
and the name of the master under works of art generally: a volume bears its
title and author's name; and pictures, to many, are as sealed books till inquiry
is stimulated or interest quickened by similar means. When the description is
too long to admit of this, the words "see Catalogue, No. &mdash;" might be added.</p>

<div class="footnote">

</div>

<p>If colour is admitted any where in the library, it might be in subjects on
the ceiling, allowable here, if at all, in the region of easy chairs and occasional
meditation; perhaps too, to a certain extent, in the windows. The introduction
of subjects on ceilings has not been recommended generally, but
in the system of arabesque painting the universal decoration of the walls
requires to be carried into the ceiling. Sculpture, from the reasons already
given, or rather in accordance with the same taste, is quite admissible in the
library. Cicero frequently writes to his friend at Athens, to send him any
good works in sculpture, fit to adorn the library and residence of a man of
letters.<a name="FNanchor_12" id="FNanchor_12"></a><a href="#Footnote_12" class="fnanchor">[12]</a></p>

Greek style, representing a philosopher reading, was found in the ruins of Cicero's Tusculan
villa. Some English sculptors and myself, during an excursion from Rome, first, I may almost say,
discovered this marble, walled into the staircase of the Episcopal palace at Grotta Ferrata.
A mould was afterwards taken from it, through the exertions of Mr. Gibson, and the cast is now
common in Rome. The marble was, I think, afterwards removed to the Vatican.</p>
</div>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_61" id="Page_61">61</a></span>But the choicest works of taste should unquestionably be in the room
most occupied in hours of calm seclusion and leisure; and in order to find
wall enough for the pictures, this may be assumed to be the principal drawing
room. Here, therefore, may be the best specimens of painting, and even of
sculpture, if the space permits: here, the chimney-piece may be by Flaxman,
and the doors of the print-case by Stothard. The pictures cannot be very
large, on account of their number and the size of the room. This, the
objection which in a great measure excludes the grandest works from our
dwelling houses, was met by the Italians, and by Nicolo Poussin, by reducing
the grand to domestic conditions. If you have only small pictures, however,
you cannot cover the upper part of the walls, for you are not supposed to
have any work of art <em>here</em> which can be sacrificed.</p>

<p>Enlightened connoisseurs see excellence both in the Dutch and Italian
schools, but they are often embarrassed in arranging them together. I am
convinced, however, from instances I have seen, that this is to be accomplished
satisfactorily. It is sometimes argued, that no one reads Milton and Crabbe
alternately; but this is hardly a parallel case. Many go to a gallery to look
at a particular picture, and see nothing else; the eye is blind when the
attention is not actively exerted. So in a room, the spectator selects his
favourites&mdash;his favourites at least for the time, and scarcely looks beyond
them. At another moment, he will perhaps direct his undivided attention to
works which he passed over on a former occasion. A certain congruity is
sometimes to be accomplished, by attending to impressions rather than names
and schools. Many an Italian picture would not be out of place with the
Flemish and Dutch school; while Vandyck, Rembrandt, Cuyp, and others,
might sometimes harmonize in many respects with the genius of the south. The
arrangement of pictures comprehends some of the difficulties which the artist
experiences in the production of <em>one</em>; for a certain balance and repose are as
essential for the eye, as an harmonious impression for the mind. Much must,
therefore, depend on the nature of the materials; and the (assumed) different
character of your two drawing rooms may here be an advantage.</p>

<p>You, I know, will not ask whether the productions of the English school
are admissible in this "Tribune" as well as elsewhere. Such is the variety<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_62" id="Page_62">62</a></span>
of English art, that the more refined Dutch, the Flemish, and the Italian taste,
may be recognized in it by turns, and no modern pictures harmonize with the
scheme of colour and effect which characterize the master-works of former
ages so well as the English of the last century. Thus much of schools, and
those we have not mentioned may be tried by the same tests.</p>

<p>With regard to subjects, the mind as well as the eye must be respected:
the <em>ethos</em> of painting is quite compatible with familiar and homely subjects;
and, on the other hand, the greatest Italian masters have sometimes sought
for poetic impressions in regions where it would be unsafe to follow them.
But, with this reservation, you must not be exclusive: various minds, or the
same mind in various moods, will like variety of aliment. In other situations,
which we have had occasion to consider, the subject has been in a great
degree calculated on the probable feelings of the spectator; here, the subject
is independent, because the attention is free, and the whole art appeals by
turns to the whole range of thought. The leisure of cultivated human beings
should be so far complimented as to assume that all the strivings of the mind
are worthy to be ministered to. It is a mistake to suppose that solemn or
even terrible themes are always objectionable; I believe it will be found
that the grander efforts of invention (I speak of works by the ancient masters)
are very generally appreciated by the gentler sex. On the other hand, the
fondness for humbler subjects is not always referable to the homeliness of the
incident represented. The subject often acquires elevation, and commands
respect, by the evidence of mental labour and power in the artist. To a true
connoisseur, this skilful application of principles derived from universal nature,
supersedes the mere subject; and the idea which he recognizes, whatever may
be its vehicle, is grand and poetical. Less experienced observers are often
deceived by the title of pictures: "A Court Yard" (de Hooghe) sounds
unpromising enough; but when it is seen that the painter has represented
<em>daylight</em> with magical truth, and that all is subservient to this, his aim must
be acknowledged to be dignified. It is to be observed too, that the influence
of this high aim on the part of the artist, often extends itself to the treatment
of the materials which constitute his ostensible subject. It is easy to see from
the unaffected feeling, as well as from the <em>relative</em> character of the execution
in some (though not all) of the Dutch masters, that the real subject of their
meditation was noble. I should like to see a <em>catalogue raisonné</em> on the
principle to which I have alluded, distinguishing the title of a picture from
the real intention of the artist. Many frequenters of the National Gallery
criticise Reynolds's Three Graces, whence it appears they are not sufficiently<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_63" id="Page_63">63</a></span>
aware that the personages in question are portraits of three fashionable ladies
of the day, under the name of the Graces, &amp;c. If some titles were translated,
what a contrast the real import of the work would present to the actual name!
What a change, for instance, from the modesty of some of &mdash;&mdash;'s titles,
"Crossing the Brook,"&mdash;"Coal-barges in the Thames: Night," to the beauty
and grandeur that would have to be clothed in language! But what language
would be adequate?</p>

<p>With respect to the colour of the walls on which pictures are hung, my
opinion is singular without being novel. I am quite aware that it is necessary
to consider wall, pictures, gold frames, and all, in relation to general effect:
the gold, especially, is to be treated as part of the coup d'&oelig;il. But, though
I remember examples of light walls hung with pictures, producing an agreeable
effect, I prefer a colour which displays the pictures more, and must also
maintain, that living pictures are seldom seen to the best advantage against a
bright ground; the quantity of actual light (it may always be assumed)
making reflected light unnecessary: my idea, in one word, is, that the wall
should not be so light as the lights of the pictures; and this supposes a sufficiently
low tint. Of such colours, the most agreeable is the long established
rich red, which might be sufficiently allied to purple, to give value to the
gold frames and the warm colour of the pictures. I need not recommend
you to avoid too much unbroken polish in the frames, since this is now very
generally disapproved of.</p>

<p>I have, as you see, exercised, apparently without scruple, the dictatorial
authority with which you have invested me; but the frequent recurrence of
"my opinion" becomes painful even to the arbiter who has a <em>carte blanche</em> to
lay down the law. As a relief, I intended to have given you some extracts
from an Italian ethical work (printed about the middle of the 16th century<a name="FNanchor_13" id="FNanchor_13"></a><a href="#Footnote_13" class="fnanchor">[13]</a>)
in which there is a chapter on the "ornamenti della casa;" but they would
have been, perhaps, little suited to your purpose, and I have already far
exceeded the space I ought to occupy. As I may not, however, again
have an opportunity of alluding to this work, which is not unimportant in
the history of Italian art, I wish briefly to advert to one or two points.</p>

<div class="footnote">
<p class="footnote"><a name="Footnote_13" id="Footnote_13"></a><a href="#FNanchor_13"><span class="label">[13]</span></a> Castiglione Saba, Ricordi ovvero Ammaestramenti, &amp;c. Milano, 1559.</p>
</div>

<p>The list of pictures given seems to prove that the Italians long remained
faithful to the older masters. The names of Titian and Coreggio do not
appear! (I hope you will not follow the Catalogue in such defects.) This is
not to be explained, by supposing that the writer speaks for himself only; for<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_64" id="Page_64">64</a></span>
he repeatedly says, "Some like to ornament their rooms with the works of &mdash;&mdash;,
others, with those of &mdash;&mdash;," and so on, as if professing to give a variety of
tastes. I can only account for this in one way: the author lived in Milan,
and it would appear that the taste of Leonardo, closely allied as it was to
that of the schools of Central Italy, long continued to influence the Milanese
amateurs as well as the Milanese painters.</p>

<p>I pass over the musical instruments, which, beside their chief use,
"piacciono assai al'occhio," especially when made by Lorenzo da Pavia, or
Bastiano da Verona. Donatello, Michael Angelo, Alfonso Lombardi, and
Cristoforo Romano, are the sculptors he enumerates. The terra cottas are
by Pagaino da Modena; the bronzes by Verocchio and Pollaiuolo. Beside
antique medals, he admires those of Giovanni Corona of Venice, together
with the chasings of Caradosso. Among the works of the latter, he mentions
a silver inkstand in basso rilievo, "fatica d'anni venti sei! ma certo divina."
Cameos and intaglios should be, he thinks, by the hand of Pietro Maria,
Tagliacarne, &amp;c. but above all by Giovanni di Castello.</p>

<p>Now for his list of painters: Filippo Lippi, Mantegna, Giovanni Bellini,
Leonardo da Vinci, although, he adds, he left but few works.<a name="FNanchor_14" id="FNanchor_14"></a><a href="#Footnote_14" class="fnanchor">[14]</a> Then follow
the younger Lippi, and Perugino, and, heralded with appropriate honours,
Raphael, accompanied by Giulio Romano. Pietro della Francesca, and Melozzo
da Forlì, are characterized well, as indeed are all the painters. He next
mentions some artists, all monks, who wrought in inlaid wood; (commesso,
tarsia;) but his highest praises in this department are reserved for Fra Damiano
da Bergamo, the artist of the choir of S. Domenico at Bologna. The engravings
he speaks of are by Albert Durer and Lucas van Leyden.</p>

<div class="footnote">
<p class="footnote"><a name="Footnote_14" id="Footnote_14"></a><a href="#FNanchor_14"><span class="label">[14]</span></a> The author says he was an eye-witness of the Gascon crossbowmen making a target of
Leonardo's model for the equestrian statue of Francesco Sforza.</p>
</div>

<p>Tapestries from Flanders, carpets from Syria, Turkey, and Barbary,
figured leather from Spain, are all admitted to be desirable ornaments: "Tutti
questi ornamenti ancora commendo perchè arguiscono ingegno, politezza,
civilità e cortegiania." The author next describes his own treasures; but,
except a head by Donatello and some rare books, he has nothing to boast of.
His tastes are characteristic of the age: though a priest, his ambition is to
have a collection of arms and armour, if wrought by a good Italian or German
armourer; and above all, he aspires to the possession of a large steel mirror,
of the kind made by Giovanni della Barba, a German: the mirrors of glass
then in use, were, it appears, very small and imperfect. The author's judicious<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_65" id="Page_65">65</a></span>
observations (to which I refer you) on the chief use of mirrors, may
reconcile you to their occasional introduction over chimney pieces, which, for
the rest, are by no means the best places for pictures.</p>

<p>The chapter ends with a pleasing story about a mirror and a lady, and
Galeazzo Visconti, Duke of Milan, a story not unworthy to be a <em>pendant</em> for
"Collalto,"<a name="FNanchor_15" id="FNanchor_15"></a><a href="#Footnote_15" class="fnanchor">[15]</a> and which might have furnished a subject for the graceful
pencil of Stothard; but it is time to make an end.</p>
